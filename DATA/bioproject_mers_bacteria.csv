Rhodopseudomonas palustris Strain RP2,PRJEB18963,"An electrophototrophic, hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris stain RP2 was isolated from the anodic biofilms of hydrocarbon fed microbial electrochemical remediation systems (MERS). Metabolic properties of the strain RP2 were direct electrode respiration, dissimilatory metal oxide reduction, spore formation, anaerobic nitrate reduction, free living diazotrophy and the ability to degrade n-alkane components of petroleum hydrocarbons (PH) in anoxic, photic environments. Such observations reveal the importance of photoorganotrophic growth in the utilization of hydrocarbons from contaminated environments. Identification of such novel petrochemical hydrocarbon degrading electricigens, not only expands the knowledge on the range of bacteria known for the hydrocarbon bioremediation but also shows a biotechnological potential that goes well beyond its applications to MERS.Less...",

"The FibroChip, a functional DNA microarray to monitor cellulolysis and hemicellulolysis activities of rumen microbiota",PRJNA420557;,"Ruminants are the most efficient herbivorous animals to transform plant biomass into edible products, principally thanks to the rumen microbiota that produces a large array of enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of plant cell wall polysaccharides. Several biotic and abiotic factors influence the efficiency of fiber degradation, which can ultimately impact the animal productivity and health. To provide more insight on mechanisms involved in the modulation of fibrolytic activity, a functional DNA microarray targeting genes coding for key enzymes involved in cellulose and hemicellulose degradation by rumen microbiota was designed. The DNA microarray, designated FibroChip, was validated using targets of increasing complexity. This new tool demonstrated sensitivity and specificity as well as explorative and semi-quantitative potential.
The FibroChip was designed with the objective to propose a high throughput tool that enables to get a rapid picture of the capacity of rumen microorganisms to degrade cellulose and hemicellulose based on a targeted metatranscriptomics approach. We chose to focus on a few number of genes by targeting main ruminal fibrolytic microorganisms and selected CAZyme families that may have a pivotal role in cellulose and hemicellulose degradation. The microarray targets the coding sequence of catalytic domains from 8 CAZyme families involved in cellulose and hemicellulose degradation (i.e. glycoside hydrolases GH5, GH9, GH10, GH11, GH43 and GH48, and carbohydrate esterases CE1 and CE6). Taken together, these families present complementary activities needed for the complete degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose. In total, 392 nucleic sequences encoding 363 GH and 29 CE were kept for the microarray design. These sequences originated from 41 bacterial species, 4 protozoal species and 10 fungal species. The microarray is composed of 1631 25-mer probes. GoArrays strategy consisting by associating 2 25-mer probes targeting the same gene (Rimour et al., 2005) was also emplyed to determine 2618 composite probes of 54-mers. Triplicate of probes of 25 and 54-mers were synthetized in situ on an Agilent 8x15K DNA microarray. The microarray contained also 382 Agilent internal control probes including positive controls, negative controls and quality control probes. Probes were randomly placed on the array to avoid position bias.
Overall design: The objective of this work was to validate the FibroChip design and evaluate its sensitivity and specificity. For this, targets of increasing complexity were tested: PCR products, then bacterial genomic DNA, RNA from one bacteria, and finally RNA from a cow rumen content (complex microbial community). (1) PCR products were amplified from 7 genes selected to represent the diversity of targeted CAZyme families and microorganisms. Genes were cloned beforehand to ensure that a unique sequence was hybridized. (2)  Genomic DNA from the strain Escherichia coli K12 was used to assess the specificity of probes as no gene from this bacterium was targeted on the FibroChip whearas the gDNA from 3 targeted bacteria strains (Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus albus 20 and Bacteroides xylanisolvens XB1A) were used to assess the sensitivity of the DNA microarray. (3) To test the ability of the FibroChip to detect the differential expression of genes, the microarray was used to analyze the transcriptome of the rumen bacterium Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, cultivated in two media differing by their carbon source, i.e. the simple sugar cellobiose (C) or the complex substrate wheat straw (WS). (4) The FibroChip was then used to analyze the metatranscriptome of a cow rumen content. The rumen sample was from a dairy cow fed a mixed diet and was previously analyzed for fibrolytic activity using a RNAseq metatranscriptomics approach (Comtet-Marre et al., 2017).Less...",GSE107550
Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1,PRJNA123749;,"Legionella pneumophila is a gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen that infects and multiplies in a broad range of phagocytic protozoan and mammalian phagocytes. Based on the observation that small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) play an important role in controlling virulence-related genes in several pathogenic bacteria, we attempted to test the hypothesis that sRNAs play a similar role in L. pneumophila. We used computational prediction followed by experimental verification to identify and characterize sRNAs encoded in the L. pneumophila genome.   A 50-mer probe microarray was constructed to test the expression of predicted sRNAs in bacteria grown under a variety of conditions. This strategy successfully identified 22 expressed RNAs, out of which six were confirmed by northern blot and RACE. One of the identified sRNAs is highly expressed when the bacteria enter post exponential phase and computational prediction of its secondary structure reveals a striking similarity to the structure of 6S RNA, a widely distributed prokaryotic sRNA, known to regulate the activity of σ70-containing RNAP. A 70-mer probe microarray was used to identify genes affected by L. pneumophila 6S RNA in stationary phase. The 6S RNA encoded by the ssrS gene positively regulates expression of genes encoding type IVB secretion system effectors, stress response genes such as groES and recA as well as many genes with unknown or hypothetical functions. Deletion of 6S RNA significantly reduced L. pneumophila intracellular multiplication in both protist and mammalian host cells, but had no detectable effect on growth in rich media.
Overall design: A microarray was designed for the detection of 101 predicted sRNAs by using OligiWiz version 2.1.3 (Nielsen et al., 2003, Wernersson & Nielsen, 2005). The prokaryotic setting was used to design 50-mers probes located, when possible, at the 3’ end of the predicted genes. Probes for 10 negative controls, representing 10 genes of the L. pneumophila Paris plasmid, were also designed. Probes (Illumina) were dissolved in 50% DMSO to a final concentration of 30 uM and printed in triplicate on UltraGAPS coated glass slides (Corning) using a PerkinElmer SpotArray microarray printer. Fifteen micrograms of total RNA was labelled during cDNA synthesis using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and amino-allyl dUTP (Sigma). Bacterial genomic DNA was used as the reference channel on each slide to allow comparison of each time point and different samples (Talaat et al., 2002). Five micrograms of genomic DNA (gDNA) was labelled with amino-allyl dUTP by using Klenow fragment and random primers (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 18 h. DNA was subsequently coupled to the succinimidyl ester fluorescent dye AlexaFluor 546 (for cDNA) or Alexa Fluor 647 (for gDNA) (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s protocols. Hybridization and data acquisition were performed as previously described (Hovel-Miner et al., 2009).Very low density array, like the sRNA microarray used here, cannot be normalised with common procedure like total intensity or lowess. Local background was removed from spot signal intensity and the noise signal was estimated by recording the average signal intensity of 10 negative controls printed on the chip. Normalisation of signal intensity was carried out by calculating the fold increase over the noise signal value. Correlation of replicates using this normalisation procedure was ≥ 0.95.Less...",GSE19196
Escherichia coli,PRJNA119781;,"The existence of two separate lineages of Escherichia coli O157:H7 has previously been reported, and research indicates that  one of these lineages (lineage I) might be more pathogenic towards human hosts. We have previously shown that the more pathogenic lineage expresses higher levels of Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2) than the non-pathogenic lineage II.  To evaluate why lineage 2 isolates do not express appreciable levels of toxin, two lineage 2 isolates (FRIK966 and FRIK2000) were chosen as representatives of lineage 2 and whole genome microarrays were performed using Agilent microarrays using the E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 lineage I clinical type isolate as a reference.  Microarray results were utilized to evaluate what genes and pathways might be missing or differentially expressed.  Quantitative RT-PCR was utilized to validate the microarray data.
Overall design: Based upon the transcriptome of Escherichia coli O157:H7 EDL933 an oligonucleotide microarray, made up of 60 mers was designed.  A total of 4873 genes in an 8 x 15K Agilent microarray design.  Designed using a custom script, specifications for gene specific oligos were based upon various design characteristics such as temperature of melting, 3’ location, specificity, lack of repeat nucleotides, etc. (Charbonnier et al., 2005).  Arrays were manufactured using Agilent Sure-print technology.  Each array consisted of duplicate elements for each gene randomly distributed with Agilent control elements included.
All procedures were performed according to respective manufacturer protocols.  Lineage I and lineage II strains were grown overnight as described, a total of 10e7 cells were washed twice in fresh media, normalized based upon optical density,  inoculated into fresh media, incubated at 37oC shaking 120 x g for 3 hours and then suspended in RNAprotect bacteria reagent (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA.).  Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Bacteria Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA.) and trace amounts of DNA were removed using RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA.).  RNA was quantified using Nanodrop system (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and quality confirmed by electrophoresis on a Bio-rad Experion system (BioRad XXX).  For each sample, 10 ug of RNA were labeled with either CyDye3-dCTP or CyDye5-dCTP (Perkin Elmer) using the LabelStar kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA.) and Random nonamers (Integrated DNA Technologies ).  Labeled cDNA were hybridized to the microarray using Agilent Hi-RPM hybridization solution in an Agilent Hybridization chamber (Agilent.). A total of 8 arrays, each with duplicate elements for each gene, alternating dye swap for each replicate (4 biological replicates), were analyzed to obtain genes that were consistently and differentially regulated in comparison to EDL933, while limiting false discover rate (FDR) below a stringent 5% (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).Less...",GSE17070
Protein translation as major target for gene expression control of O. tsutsugamushi,PRJNA117253;,"Orientia tsutsugamushi, an obligate intracellular bacterium, is the causative agent of Scrub typhus. The bacterium can replicate both in its arthropod host and in mammals, including humans. The control mechanisms for bacterial gene expression within eukaryotic host cells are largely unknown. Previously, we reported that the O. tsutsugamushi genome has the highest repeat density of any sequenced bacterial genome due to the extraordinary proliferation of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), suggesting a unique genomic evolution in intracellular niches. In this study, the global gene expression of O. tsutsugamushi within eukaryotic cells was examined using a microarray and proteomic approaches. These approaches identified 643 genes, corresponding to approximately 30% of genes encoded in the genome. The majority of expressed genes belonged to several functional categories including protein translation, protein processing/secretion, and replication/repair. We also searched the conserved sequence blocks (CSBs) in the genomes of different O. tsutsugamushi strains to identify gene blocks impermeable to proliferating MGEs. Although extensive shuffling of genomic sequences was observed between two different strains, 204 CSBs with sizes ranging from 1 kbp to 29 kbp, covering 48% of the genome, were identified. When combining the data of the CSBs and global gene expression, CSBs in the O. tsutsugamushi genomes correlates well with the location of expressed genes, especially in protein level, suggesting the functional conservation between gene expression and genomic location. Finally, we compared global gene expression of the bacteria infecting fibroblasts and macrophages using microarray analysis. Major changes in the expression of genes with known functions were the downregulation of genes involved in translation, protein processing and secretion, which resulted in significant reduction in bacterial translation rates and growth within macrophages. These results suggest that the replication of O. tsutsgamushi is controlled primarily by the expression of genes involved in bacterial translation and subsequent protein processing/secretion.
Overall design: Microarray analysis using the Combimatrix CustomArrayTM 4X2 microarray (CombiMatrix) was performed according to the standard CombiMatrix protocol described in detail at http://www.combimatrix.com/ products_custom4x2.htm (PTL005). Oligonucleotide probes (27 to 40-mers, 1613 probes) were designed for 1472 CDSs of the O. tsutsugamushi genome (GeneBank accession no. AM494475). 1 to 6 probes per CDS were designed and some probes were duplicated on the microarray (total 2187 spots on an array). As negative controls, 5 and 15 oligonucleotide probes derived from plant and bacteriophage respectively were spotted on the array at 53 sites per array. A local background subtraction method was used and the background-subtracted signal values were imported into the Avadis Prophetic software (ver. 3.3, Strand Genomics) or Expander (ver. 4.1, http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/expander/) for data analysis. . Global normalization of gene expression data was performed using the quantile normalization method embedded in the Expander software. The standard deviations of log data and the p-values were calculated using default settings in the Avadis software. Transcriptome analysis was carried out using three biological replicates for uninfected samples (uninfected L929 cells) and five biological replicates for infected samples (L929 cells infected with O. tsutsugamushi for 48 h). For comparison of the O. tsutsugamushi transcriptome from fibroblasts (L929 cells) and macrophages (J774A.1 cells), two biological replicates from each cell line were used.Less...",GSE16966
Brucella melitensis,PRJNA107509;,"A mini-microarray containing spotted oligos corresponding to 289 B. melitensis genes was used to identify candidate genes whose transcription is influenced by BlxR.  This microarray contains genes encoding the type IV secretion system, flagella, transcriptional regulators, transporters, and proteins involved in outer membrane biogenesis, iron acquisition, and denitrification.  RNA was prepared from both B. melitensis 16M, and the blxR deletion strain, 16M(delta)blxR, grown to late log phase in TSB.
Keywords: genetic modification
Overall design: Bacteria were grown in TSB until mid/late-log phase.  Before RNA isolation, phenol-ethanol (1:19) was added, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at -80°C.  Total RNA was extracted from cell pellets using the MasterPure RNA Purification Kit (Epicentre), and DNA was removed using TURBO DNA-free (Ambion).  cDNA was synthesized from 7 ug of total RNA in the presence of CyDye-3-dCTP (Amersham Biosciences).  The labeled cDNA was purified using the ChipShot cDNA System (Promega).  For each sample, RNA was extracted from two independently grown cultures and cDNA was generated three times for each RNA sample.
For the mini-microarray, 289 potential open reading frames (ORF’s) of the B. melitensis 16M genome were selected based on their hypothesized involvement in virulence.  These included genes for proteins involved in: type IV secretion, flagella, outer membrane biogenesis, transcriptional regulation, denitrification, iron uptake, and peptide and small molecule transport.  Oligonucleotides (70-mers) representing these 289 genes were purchased from Qiagen, re-suspended in 3x SSC, and spotted onto Ultra GAPS coated slides (Corning) using the MicroGrid Microarrayer (Apogent Discoveries).  Slides were desiccated in a vacuum oven with Drierite for 48 h and UV cross linked using a Stratalinker at 600 mJ.  The printing of each ORF spot was verified by hybridizing with Cy3 labeled 9 mer (Qiagen).  The slides were stored under vacuum at room temp with “Drierite” pellets until further use.
16M genomic DNA was labeled by incorporation of CyDye-5-dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) using High Prime DNA Labeling (Roche) according to manufacturer’s instructions.  Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using Micron YM-30 Columns (Millipore).
Cy3-labeled cDNA was mixed with 0.75 ug cy5-labeled gDNA, and hybridization buffer (Pronto Plus Kit, Promega) was added to a final volume of 35 ul.  The entire sample was loaded onto the printed array and covered with a HybriSlip coverslip (Molecular Probes).  Arrays were placed in specialized hybridization chambers (Telechem Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), and incubated at 42°C overnight.  Slides were washed using the Pronto Plus Hybridization System (Promega) and dried by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min.
Slides were scanned using the GenePix4000B scanner (Axon Instruments) with independent excitation of the fluorophores Cy3 and Cy5.  Background intensities for each spot were calculated using GenPixPro 3.0 software (Axon Instruments) via the segmentation method.  The signal intensity for each spot was calculated as the difference between the average signal intensity and the average local background intensity.  Data was normalized to gDNA levels by calculating the ratios of cDNA to gDNA for each spot.  Data was then log2 transformed, and the signal ratio for each spot was divided by the mean signal ratio of the entire array to validate comparisons between different arrays.  Data normalization and statistical analysis were performed using TIGR MeV.

Porphyromonas gingivalis,PRJNA106395;,"Polyphosphate (polyP) is a ubiquitous and abundant compound found in bacteria, fungi, algae, plant, and animals. Among roles of intracellular polyP in bacteria are resistance and survival in the stationary phase of the growth against stress and stringent condition. Therefore, intracellular polyP is considered as a virulence factor of bacteria. In contrast, exogenous polyP has an antimicrobial activity against a variety of microorganisms. To date, much has been numerous studies of antibacterial effect of polyP against gram positive bacteria and fungi while relatively little reports have been published concerning gram negative bacteria. Here we describe bactericidal effect of polyP against gram negative periodontopathic bacterium, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and the transcriptional change by polyP in this bacterium. The bacterial growth was inhibited by polyP (chain length of P3~P75) at concentration of 0.02~0.03%, but not by Pi and PPi at the concentrations. polyP75 was chosen for further experiments, which suppressed the further growth of P. gingivalis as low as 0.03%. polyP75 completely killed the bacterial cells at the concentration of 0.035%. Microarray analysis was employed to identify genes that showed a greater than 1.5-fold difference in the expression by polyP75 at the concentration of 0.03%. It was found that 155 genes were up-regulated and 173 were down-regulated. Down-regulated genes include groups of energy metabolism-related genes, cell envelope-related genes, and genes in relation to biosynthesis of cofactors, prosthetic groups and carriers. Among the down-regulated genes were several involved in DNA replication, cell division protein, and biosynthesis of purines, pyrimidines, nucleosides and nucleotides. In contrast, a large number of ribosomal proteins, transciptional regulators and transposases were up-regulated. Oxidative stress-related genes and iron storage proteins also appeared to be increased in the expression. Real-time PCR confirmed up- and down-regulation of some selected genes. The overall results suggest that polyP has a bactericidal activity against P. gingivalis, interfering with translation, energy metabolism, DNA replication, cell division, and biosynthesis of purines, pyrimidines, nucleoside and nucleotides. polyP may be used as an agent for prevention and treatment of periodontal infections.

Overall design: Twenty μg of each total RNA sample was used in separate hybridization experiments on identical arrays. The whole genome of 1,909 genes of P. gingivalis W83 (GenBank accession no. NC_002950) was submitted to NimbleGen System Inc. (Madison, WI) for microarray design and manufacture using maskless, digital micromirror technology. Five replicates of the genome were included per chip. An average of 19 different 60-base oligonucleotides (60-mer probes) represented each gene in the genome. Sixty-mer probes were selected such that each probe had at least three mismatches compared to all other 60-mers in the target genome. A quality control check (hybridization) was performed for each array, which contained on-chip control oligonucleotides. The arrays were analyzed using an Axon GenePix 4000B microarray scanner with associated software (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Gene expression levels were calculated with NimbleScan Version 2.3 (NimbleGen). Relative signal intensities for each gene were generated using the Robust Multi-Array Average algorithm. The data were processed based on quantile normalization method using the R package. This normalization method aims to make the distribution of intensities for each array in a set of arrays the same. The background-adjusted, normalized, and log transformed intensity values were then analyzed using GeneSpring GX 7.3.1 (Silicon Genetics, Palo Alto, CA).Less...",GSE11471
Transcriptome Profiling of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola on two different medias,PRJNA105201;,"Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) are important bacterial pathogens of the worldwide staple and grass model, rice. Xoo invades rice vascular tissue to cause bacterial leaf blight, a serious disease of rice throughout the world. Xoc colonizes the parenchyma tissue to cause bacterial leaf steak, a disease of emerging importance. We have designed oligonucleotide probes (50-70-mers) represented 2,858 Xoo genes and 1,816 Xoc genes annotated by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). To validate the Xo arrays, self-hybridization samples and tests of the non-specific hybridization using randomly spotted oligonucleotides corresponding to the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hph), and blank spot and of the correlation coefficient between biological replicates as well as between duplicate spots revealed that the data generated from our oligo array were highly reliable and consistent. To demonstrate application of Xo array, we performed expression profiling experiments on arrays hybridized with RNA of Xoo and Xoc grown in the two different nutrient-condition media. Several sets of genes involved in bacterial movement, chemotaxis, and hrp genes differentially express in response to different treatment. Due to comprehensive views of microarray study, extended biological events of plant-bacteria interaction was described. This publicly available microarray for Xanthomonas oryzae (Xo) is an enabling resource for a large and international community of scientists to better understand not only Xo biology but also many other Xanthomonas species that cause significant losses on crops.

Design and testing of genome-proxy microarrays to profile marine microbial communities,PRJNA103099;,"Microarrays are useful tools for detecting and quantifying specific functional and phylogenetic genes in natural microbial communities. In order to track uncultivated microbial genotypes and their close relatives in an environmental context, we designed and implemented a “genome proxy” microarray that targets microbial genome fragments recovered directly from the environment. Fragments consisted of sequenced clones from large-insert genomic libraries from microbial communities in Monterey Bay, the Hawaii Ocean Time-series station ALOHA, and Antarctic coastal waters. In a prototype array, we designed probe sets to thirteen of the sequenced genome fragments and to genomic regions of the cultivated cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus MED4. Each probe set consisted of multiple 70-mers, each targeting an individual ORF, and distributed along each ~40-160kbp contiguous genomic region. The targeted organisms or clones, and close relatives, were hybridized to the array both as pure DNA mixtures and as additions of cells to a background of coastal seawater. This prototype array correctly identified the presence or absence of the target organisms and their relatives in laboratory mixes, with negligible cross-hybridization to organisms having ≤~75% genomic identity. In addition, the array correctly identified target cells added to a background of environmental DNA, with a limit of detection of ~0.1% of the community, corresponding to ~10^3 cells/ml in these samples. Signal correlated to cell concentration with an R2 of 1.0 across six orders of magnitude. In addition the array could track a related strain (at 86% genomic identity to that targeted) with a linearity of R2=0.9999 and a limit of detection of ~1% of the community. Closely related genotypes were distinguishable by differing hybridization patterns across each probe set. This array’s multiple-probe, “genome-proxy” approach and consequent ability to track both target genotypes and their close relatives is important for the array’s environmental application given the recent discoveries of considerable intra-population diversity within marine microbial communities.

Overall design: ***Overall Array design***

The prototype microarray targeted thirteen BAC or fosmid genome fragments (20-160kb) from both bacteria and archaea, recovered from a variety of marine habitats, as well as the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus MED4. These clones were originally sequenced because of the presence of taxonomic marker or specific functional genes. This array consisted of sets of 70-bp oligonucleotides targeting each genome or genome fragment (Fig. 1), dispersed along the target sequences with no more than one probe per gene, and excluding rRNA genes as targets. The probes were selected solely based on theoretical thermodynamic properties and GC content (~40%); that is, probe selection did not focus on specific genes or regions, but simply produced the “optimal” probes for each genome proxy based on the probes’ predicted hybridization properties. rRNA genes were excluded, because this probe design approach, which avoids sequence alignments and considerations of RNA secondary structure, would be unlikely to result in useful rRNA probes. Furthermore, rRNA probes of traditional design could not be included on the array because their appropriate hybridization conditions would be very different from those of this array’s probes. 

***Microarray probe design***

Microarray 70-mer probes were designed using the program ArrayOligoSelector (Zhu et al., 2003) with the following settings: target %GC = 40%, 1 probe/gene, with the ORFs for each genome fragment as both the input and the database file. The output candidate 70mers were then sorted based on their %GC and those closest to 40% were chosen. In the case of more than the target number of probes having 40%GC, the subset with the lowest free energy of hybridization were selected as probes. Generally, 20 probes were selected per organism. Prochlorococcus MED4 was represented by 60 probes total, 20 each for three different 80kb “genome-proxy” regions: 0-80kb, 1.29-1.37Mbp, and 1.58 to 1.66Mbp. 

Using the same method, a set (n=20) of positive control probes were designed to the genome of the halophillic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1. Negative control probes (n=28) were designed to a set of 49 random 1000-base sequences (Stothard, 2000). 

***Microarray construction and hybridization***

Oligonucleotides were synthesized (Illumina, San Diego, California), suspended in 3XSSC to a concentration of 40pmol/μl, and spotted on homemade poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides using a QArray 2 microarraying robot (Genetix, Hampshire, England). Six replicates of each probe were spotted.

***Microarray data analysis***

Hybridized arrays were scanned using an Axon Instruments 4000B scanner (Foster City, CA) and the data was normalized and filtered using perl scripts written for the purpose, by the following steps. (1) Signal intensities for each spot were calculated by subtracting the local background (mean F532 – median B532, as calculated by GenePix Pro 5.1 software, Axon Instruments). (2) The median value across replicates was calculated for each probe. (3) For each probe set, the number of probes greater than twice the mean negative control signal was calculated, before further processing. (4) Filter I: Arrays with less than half their positive control probes exceeding twice the mean negative control signal were considered poor quality, low dynamic range, arrays and were excluded from further analysis. (5) Each probe signal was corrected for non-specific binding by subtracting the mean negative control spot signal. (6) The data was then normalized for array-to-array variations in brightness by dividing each probe signal by the mean positive control signal. This positive control signal was the mean signal across the Halobacterium salinarum probes in each hybridization, with identical amounts of H. salinarum DNA having been added to each reaction prior to amplification and labeling. (7) Filter II: In order for a genotype to be considered “present”, at least 45% of its probes had to exceed twice the mean negative control signal. (8) Finally, each genotype signal was calculated as either the MEAN or TUKEY BIWEIGHT across its probe set. 

***Experimental Design***

The array was hybridized to laboratory mixtures of cloned environmental genomic DNA targeted by the array, in varying ratios. The use of multiple probes to target many genes from each organism helped to normalize probe-to-probe heterogeneity, by averaging across all probes in a set (as described below). The evenness of probe response across each genotype’s set was also used to evaluate the relatedness of hybridizing DNA. 

To more precisely define the array’s phylogenetic range and specificity, it was tested against DNA from Prochlorococcus MED4 and related strains, spanning the known range of Prochlorococcus phylogenetic diversity. 

To test the effects of hybridization stringency on the specificity and signal of the MED4 probes, Prochlorococcus strains were hybridized at a range of conditions.

To test whether the specificity results for Prochlorococcus were comparable for other targeted clades, two genome fragments recovered from closely related phylotypes within the SAR86 clade of the gamma-proteobacteria were represented on the array, and were tested for specificity.

To understand the equivalence of probe sets targeting different regions of the same organism’s genome, we targeted three 80kb “genome proxy” regions of the Prochlorococcus MED4 genome. One of the regions fell in a genomic “island” where inter-strain variability is concentrated (“ISL5” in Coleman et al., 2006).

To test the array in a complex environmental context, we collected coastal seawater (lacking detectable Prochlorococcus cells by flow cytometry) and added Prochlorococcus cells from strains MED4, MIT9515, MIT9312 and MIT9313 over a range of concentrations from ~101 – 106 cells/ml (Fig. 3). The seawater was then filtered and the DNA extracted, amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the array.Less...",GSE9384
