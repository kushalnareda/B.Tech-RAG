ReQuant data,PRJEB77524,"Nanopore sequencing allows identification of base modifications, such as methylation, directly from raw current data. Prevailing  approaches, including deep learning (DL) methods, require training data covering all possible sequence contexts. This data can be prohibitively expensive or impossible to obtain for some modifications. Hence, research into DNA modifications focuses on the most prevalent modification in human DNA: 5mC in a CpG context. Improved generalisation is required to reach the technology’s full potential: calling any modification from raw current data.
We developed ReQuant, an algorithm to impute full, k-mer based, modification models from limited k-mer context examples. Our method is highly accurate for calling modifications (CpG/GpC methylation, and CpG glucosylation) in Lambda phage R9 data when fitting on ≤25% of all possible 6-mers with a modification, and extends to human R10 data.
The success of our approach shows that DNA modifications have a consistent and therefore predictable effect on Nanopore current levels, suggesting that interpretable rule-based imputation in unseen contexts is possible. Our approach circumvents the complexity of modification-specific DL tools and enables modification calling when not all sequence contexts can be obtained, opening up a vast field of biological base modification research.Less...",

"A synthetic control genome provides a universal molecular standard to measure DNA, mRNA and protein expression.",PRJNA1073056,"The phi X 174 bacteriophage was first sequenced in 1977, and has since become the most widely used standard in molecular biology and next-generation sequencing. However, with the advent of affordable DNA synthesis and de novo gene design, we considered whether we could engineer a synthetic genome, termed SynX, specifically tailored for use as a universal molecular standard. The SynX genome encodes 21 synthetic genes that can be in vitro transcribed to generate matched mRNA controls, and in vitro translated to generate matched protein controls. This enables the use of SynX as a matched control to compare across genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic experiments. The synthetic genes provide qualitative controls that measure sequencing accuracy across k-mers, GC-rich and repeat sequences, as well as act as quantitative controls that measure sensitivity and quantitative accuracy. We show how the SynX genome can measure DNA sequencing, evaluate gene expression in RNA sequencing experiments, or quantify proteins in mass spectometry. Unlike previous spike-in controls, the SynX DNA, RNA and protein controls can be independently and sustainably prepared by recipient laboratories using common molecular biology techniques, and widely shared as a universal molecular standard.Less...",

Efficacy of the oral nucleoside prodrug GS-5245 (Obeldesivir) against SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses with pandemic potential,PRJNA1069089;,"Despite the wide availability of several safe and effective vaccines that can prevent severe COVID-19 disease, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) that can partially evade vaccine immunity remains a global health concern. In addition, the emergence of highly mutated and neutralization-resistant SARS-CoV-2 VOCs such as BA.1 and BA.5 that can partially or fully evade (1) many therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in clinical use underlines the need for additional effective treatment strategies. Here, we characterize the antiviral activity of GS-5245, Obeldesivir (ODV), an oral prodrug of the parent nucleoside GS-441524, which targets the highly conserved RNA-dependent viral RNA polymerase (RdRp). Importantly, we show that GS-5245 is broadly potent in vitro against alphacoronavirus HCoV-NL63, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-related Bat-CoV RsSHC014, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 WA/1, and the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 BA.1 Omicron variant in vitro and highly effective as antiviral therapy in mouse models of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 (WA/1), MERS-CoV and Bat-CoV RsSHC014 pathogenesis. In all these models of divergent coronaviruses, we observed protection and/or significant reduction of disease metrics such as weight loss, lung viral replication, acute lung injury, and degradation in pulmonary function in GS-5245-treated mice compared to vehicle controls. Finally, we demonstrate that GS-5245 in combination with the main protease (Mpro) inhibitor nirmatrelvir had increased efficacy in vivo against SARS-CoV-2 compared to each single agent. We also evalulate the effect of antiviral therapy on host gene expression using RNAseq and show that therapeutic intervention reduces host inflammatory response as compared to vehicle controls during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Altogether, our data supports the continuing clinical evaluation of GS-5245 in humans infected with COVID-19, including as part of a combination antiviral therapy, especially in populations with the most urgent need for more efficacious and durable interventions.
Overall design: 10-week old female BALB/c mice were infected at 1 x 10^4 PFU with SARS-CoV-2 MA10. Mice were treated BID starting at 12 hpi with vehicle, GS-5245 (4 mg/kg), PF-332 (40 mg/kg), or in combination of GS-5245 (4 mg/kg) + PF-332 (40 mg/kg). We then performed total RNAseq to examine host gene expression profiles on 3-5 mice per group.

Tylonycteris robustula,PRJNA1066576,"Exploring wild reservoirs of pathogenic viruses is critical for their long-term control and for predicting future pandemic scenarios. Here, a comparative in vitro infection analysis was first performed on 83 cell cultures derived from 55 mammalian species using pseudotyped viruses bearing S proteins from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Cell cultures from Thomas's horseshoe bat, king horseshoe bat, green monkey, and ferret were found to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV pseudotyped viruses. Moreover, five variants (del69-70, D80Y, S98F, T572I, and Q675H) that beside spike receptor-binding domain can significantly alter the host tropism of SARS-CoV-2. An examination of phylogenetic signals of transduction rates revealed that closely related taxa generally have similar susceptibility to MERS-CoV but not to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viruses. Additionally, we discovered the expression of entry receptors, i.e., ACE2 and DPP4, shown poor correlation with susceptibility to infection across mammalian taxa. This study provides a basic documentation of likely susceptibility, variants, and molecules that underline the cross-species transmission of these coronaviruses.Less...",
Interferon signaling in the nasal epithelium distinguishes among lethal and common cold respiratory viruses and is critical for viral clearance,PRJNA1066261;,"All respiratory viruses establish primary infections in the nasal epithelium, where efficient innate immune induction may prevent dissemination to the lower airway and thus minimize pathogenesis. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause a range of pathologies, but the host and viral determinants of disease during common cold versus lethal HCoV infections are poorly understood. We model the initial site of infection using primary nasal epithelial cells cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI). HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and human rhinovirus-16 are common cold-associated viruses that exhibit unique features in this model: early induction of antiviral interferon (IFN) signaling, IFN-mediated viral clearance, and preferential replication at nasal airway temperature (33ºC) which confers muted host IFN responses. In contrast, lethal SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV encode antagonist proteins that prevent IFN-mediated clearance in nasal cultures. Our study identifies features shared among common cold-associated viruses, highlighting nasal innate immune responses as predictive of infection outcomes and nasally-directed IFNs as potential therapeutics.
Overall design: To investigate and comapre the differences in interferon signaling in nasal cell cultures infected with multiple respiratory viruses, we pooled primary nasal epithelial cells from four to six donors and grew them in air-liquid interface cultures. These cultures were then mock infected or infected with the indicated viruses at MOI = 1 for 96 hours (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63) or 48 hours (IAV and HRV-16).
We examined differences in gene expression using data obtained from bulk RNA sequencing from each infection in triplicate (duplicate for IAV).
Differential gene expression analysis was done by comparing gene expression levels in each infection condition compared to the respective mock infection for that experiment (Mock vs. MERS-CoV, Mock vs. IAV, etc.).Less...",GSE253542
CRISPR screens identify candidate host factors for SARS and MERS coronavirus infection,PRJNA1060331;,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are zoonotic pathogens that can cause severe respiratory disease in humans. Identification of the host factors that are necessary for viral infection and virus-induced cell death is critical to our understanding of the viral life cycle and can potentially aid the development of new treatment options. Here, we report CRISPR screen results of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections in derivatives of the human hepatoma cell line Huh7. Our screens identified the known entry receptors ACE2 for SARS-CoV and DPP4 for MERS-CoV. Additionally, the SARS-CoV screen uncovered several components of the NF-κB signaling pathway (CARD10, BCL10, MALT1, MAP3K7, IKBKG), while the MERS-CoV screen revealed the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein PTBP1, the ER scramblase TMEM41B, furin protease and several transcriptional and chromatin regulators as candidate factors for viral replication and/or virus-induced cell death. Together, we present several known and unknown coronavirus host factors that are of interest for further investigation.
Overall design: All experiments were performed under required biosafety conditions. For the SARS-CoV screen, a genome-wide knockout gene library using the human GeCKOv2 library (Addgene, #1000000049, gift from Feng Zhang) (PMID: 25075903) was generated in clonal Huh7.5.1-Cas9 cells expressing ACE2-IRES-TMPRSS2 (PMID: 33333024). 144 million cells were infected with SARS-CoV at an MOI of 0.0001. Surviving cells were harvested at 12 days post-infection in RLT buffer and genomic DNA was extracted with AllPrep DNA/RNA spin columns (Qiagen). Eluted DNA was irradiated for biosafety reasons. Library cells at day 0 were extracted as baseline control.
For the MERS-CoV screen, Huh7.5.1-Cas9 cells transduced with the human GeCKOv2 library were infected with MERS-CoV at an MOI of 0.0001. The furin inhibitor Decanoyl-RVKR-CMK was added to the media at 5 μM throughout the experiment to prevent excessive syncytia formation. Surviving cells were harvested in DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo) at 8 days post-infection and genomic DNA was extracted using the Quick-DNA Midiprep Plus Kit (Zymo). Uninfected, Decanoyl-RVKR-CMK-treated library cells were cultured in parallel and harvested for comparison. Library cells at day 0 were extracted as baseline control.
The sgRNA expression cassettes were amplified from genomic DNA in a two-step nested PCR using KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMixPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems) and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 using a custom sequencing primer, as previously described (PMID: 33333024).
Demultiplexed FASTQ files were processed using MaGeCK (PMID: 25476604). First, FASTQ files were aligned to a reference table containing sgRNA sequences to determine the counts of each sgRNA in each control and selected cell population. Then, count tables for GeCKO sublibraries A and B were combined and gene enrichment was calculated from sgRNA count tables using the total norm-method.Less...",GSE252396
Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus,PRJNA1058248,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Understanding of the RNA virus and its interactions with host proteins could improve therapeutic interventions for COVID-19. By using icSHAPE, we determined the structural landscape of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells and from refolded RNAs, as well as the regulatory untranslated regions of SARS-CoV-2 and six other coronaviruses. We validated several structural elements predicted in silico and discovered structural features that affect the translation and abundance of subgenomic viral RNAs in cells. The structural data informed a deep-learning tool to predict 42 host proteins that bind to SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Strikingly, antisense oligonucleotides targeting the structural elements and FDA-approved drugs inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA binding proteins dramatically reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells derived from human liver and lung tumors. Our findings thus shed light on coronavirus and reveal multiple candidate therapeutics for COVID-19 treatment.Less...",
Synthetic genetic circuit reveals overlapping binding sites underlie TF genomic occupancy,PRJNA1054605;,"Sequence-specific DNA binding by transcription factors (TFs) is required for accurately regulating target gene expression. However, rules governing TF-DNA interactions remain elusive because current high-throughput approaches to map them fail to identify lower-affinity interactions. To address this gap, we have developed PADIT-seq, a novel technology to detect TF-DNA interactions across the entire spectrum of affinities. By profiling the binding preferences of Egr1 and Hoxd13 to all possible 10-mers, we found that nucleotides flanking high-affinity binding sites create additional, overlapping lower-affinity sites that together modulate TF genomic occupancy. The formation of these extended recognition sequences is enabled by an inherent property of TF binding sites to interweave together. Highlighting the importance of lower-affinity binding sites, we provide mechanistic insights into their role in fine-tuning gene regulation.

Yeast EndoG prevents genome instability by degrading extranuclear DNA species,PRJNA1033160;,"In metazoans mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or retrotransposon cDNA released to cytoplasm are degraded by nucleases to prevent sterile inflammation. It remains unknown whether degradation of these DNA also prevents nuclear genome instability. We used an amplicon sequencing-based method in yeast enabling analysis of millions of DSB repair products. In non-dividing stationary phase cells, Pol4-mediated non-homologous end-joining increases, resulting in frequent insertions of 1-3 nucleotides, and insertions of mtDNA (NUMTs) or retrotransposon cDNA.  Yeast EndoG (Nuc1) nuclease limits insertion of cDNA and transfer of very long mtDNA (>10 kb) to the nucleus, where it forms unstable circles, while promoting the formation of short NUMTs (~45-200 bp). Nuc1 also regulates transfer of extranuclear DNA to nucleus in aging or meiosis. We propose that Nuc1 preserves genome stability by degrading retrotransposon cDNA and long mtDNA, while short NUMTs originate from incompletely degraded mtDNA. This work suggests that nucleases eliminating extranuclear DNA preserve genome stability.
Overall design: To study NUMT formation in yeast, we developed a high-throughput amplicon sequencing based method called Break-Ins (Break Insertions) which allows screening of hundreds of thousands of NHEJ products simultaneously for the events carrying NUMTs . We used yeast cells carrying a galactose-inducible HO endonuclease that generates a single double-strand break (DSB) per genome at the MATa locus. This DSB can only be repaired by NHEJ; only the cells that repaired the break imprecisely, altering the HO recognition site, can survive continuous HO induction and form colonies.Cells from an overnight saturated YEPD culture were washed twice with YEP-Raffinose, inoculated into 10 ml YEP-Raffinose and incubated overnight at 30 °C. When the density of the culture was ~2×107 cells/ml, ~1×107 cells were spread on a YEP-galactose 150mm plate and incubated at 30 °C for 5 days. Each culture was spread on 5-7 plates. Some slow growing strains were incubated 1-3 more days. Colony number was counted. Colony numbers were estimated by counting a representative sector of one plate per genotype and multiplying to cover all plates. Cells were collected using a spreader after adding 5 ml water onto each plate. Cells were pooled and mixed vigorously. ~80 μl cells were spun down and the genomic DNA was extracted using standard glass beads and phenol chloroform. The genomic DNA was treated with RNase A overnight. The genomic DNA was dissolved with water and adjusted to a concentration of 10 ng/μl. The construction of the sequencing library was adapted from Illumina’s amplicon sequencing protocol #15044223 Rev. B. Two rounds of PCR were performed to construct the sequencing library. For each sample, 3.2 μl genomic DNA, 0.5 μl 10 μM primers and 12.5 μl KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Roche, 7958927001) was used for the first round of PCR for a total volume of 25 μl. The forward primers are 66-mers that contain (5’ to 3’): 33 bases Illumina adapter sequence (TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG), 3 bases unique home index, and 30 bases (GCATAGTCGGGTTTTTCTTTTAGTTTCAGC) targeting the Mata locus which is located 12-41 bp upstream the HO cleavage site. The reverse primers are 66-mers that contain (5’ to 3’): 34 bases Illumina adapter sequence (GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTG TATAAGAGACAG), 3 bases unique home index, and 29 bases (CAACCACTCTACAAAAC CAAAACCAGGGT) targeting the MATa locus which is located 15-43 bp downstream the HO cleavage site. The following conditions were used for the first round of PCR: 95 °C for 5 min; 22 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 65 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 3 min; 72 °C for 10 min. 18μl PCR product was purified with 20μl AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63880) and eluted with 52.5 μl 10 mM Tris pH 8.5. For the second round of PCR, 5 μl purified PCR product, 5 μl Nextera XT V2 Index (Illumina, FC-131-2001) primer N7xx, 5 μl index primer S5xx, and 25 μl KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix were used. The total volume of PCR is 50 μl. The following conditions were used for PCR: 95 °C for 5 min; 8 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 3 min; 72 °C for 10 min. 40 μl PCR product was purified with 48 μl AMPure XP beads and eluted with 27.5 μl 10 mM Tris pH 8.5. The DNA concentration of each sample was determined with Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (ThermoFisher, Q32850) and the average size of the DNA was determined with TapeStation. The DNA was diluted to 4 nM using 10 mM Tris pH 8.5. An equal amount of DNA was pooled from ~20 samples into the library. The pooled library and PhiX library (Illumina, FC‐110‐3001) were denatured with 0.2 M NaOH separately and diluted with pre-chilled HT1 to 12 pM. 540μl pooled library and 60 μl PhiX were mixed, incubated at 96 °C for 2 min and immediately placed in an ice-water bath for 5 min.

Pharmacological inhibition of bromodomain and extra-terminal proteins induces NRF-2-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication and is subject to viral antagonism [ATAC-seq],PRJNA999739;,"Inhibitors of bromodomain and extra-terminal proteins (iBETs), including JQ-1, have been suggested as potential therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ORAI1 channel function is a driver in oral cancer progression and pain,PRJNA992100;,"Oral cancer causes pain associated with cancer progression. The mechanism(s) underlying the pain is not fully understood. We report here that the function of the Ca2+ channel ORAI1 is an important regulator of oral cancer pain. ORAI1 was highly expressed in tumor samples from oral cancer patients and ORAI1 activation caused sustained Ca2+ influx in human oral cancer cells. RNA-seq analysis showed broad modulation of oral cancer markers such MMPs and pain modulators by ORAI1. Inoculation of oral cancer cells lacking ORAI1 into mouse paws reduced ectopic tumor growth and allodynia, reducing secreted MMP1 levels and the excitation of trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons. The stimulation of TG neurons with MMP1 evoked an increase in action potentials. These data demonstrate an important role of ORAI1 in oral cancer progression likely by controlling the expression of MMP1 resulting in increased cancer progression and pain
Overall design: Human oral cancer cell lines (HSC-3) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM, Gibco, #11885-084) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, #26140-079) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (PS, Gibco, #15140-122). Cells were harvested by treating 0.25 % Trypsin/EDTA (Gibco, #25200-072) and subcultured (2-3x105 cells) in 100 mm dishes at 37oC in a humidified 20 % O2/ 5 % CO2 incubator for 3-4 days.

Therefore, we sequenced and assembled the genome sequences of four different wild beets, namely B. corolliflora, B. lomatogona, B. macrorhiza and P. procumbens. Together with publicly available genome resources, we harnessed this pangenome dataset A) to resolve the parental relationship of the tetraploid B. corolliflora wild beet using approaches based on k-mers, mapping, and gene sequence alignments and B) to identify regions not present in the cultivated sugar beet with relevance for future breeding endeavours.Less...",
RNA Bind-N-Seq for purified α-Synuclein and BG4 (scFV for G-quadruplex),PRJNA986023;,"Aggregation of α-synuclein may trigger the development of synucleinopathies, a progressive neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease and Dementia with Lewy bodies. We demonstrate RNA initiates α-synuclein phase transition in vitro, however, RNA binding ability and its motif remain unclear. Here, we indicate purified human α-synuclein protein preferentially binds to guanine-rich RNA sequences by RNA Bind-N-Seq using a pool of random 24-mer RNA oligonucleotides in vitro. Importantly, these hit motifs were required consecutive guanines not random, suggesting that RNA G-quadruplexes binds to α-synuclein. We also confirmed that GC content and skew of α-synuclein-enriched RNA sequences were similar to that of BG4 (G-quadruplex antibody)-enriched RNA sequences. Taken together, these data suggest that α-synuclein binds to RNA-formed G-quadruplex.

Surveillance of 16 UK native bat species through conservationist networks uncovers coronaviruses with zoonotic potential,PRJNA930603,"While the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has renewed genomic surveillance efforts in wildlife, there has been limited characterisation of bat-borne coronaviruses in Europe. We collected 48 faecal samples from all but one of the 17 bat species breeding in the UK, through an extensive network of bat rehabilitators and conservationists, and screened them for coronaviruses using deep RNA sequencing. We assembled nine novel, high-quality coronaviral genomes, comprising four alphacoronaviruses from Myotis daubentonii and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, a Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related coronavirus from Plecotus auritus, and four closely-related sarbecoviruses isolated from both horseshoe bat species Rhinolophus hipposideros and R. ferrumequinum. We further used in vitro assays to demonstrate that at least one of these sarbecoviruses can bind ACE2, the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells, which was also supported using in silico structural and sequence analyses. Although this sarbecovirus can enter human cells in vitro when ACE2 is over-expressed, our analyses indicate that it is unlikely to infect humans and would require adaptations to do so. Our findings highlight the importance of working collaboratively with conservation networks to enable larger, coordinated viral surveillance efforts and prevent the emergence of zoonoses from wildlife.Less...",

Nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) widespread RNA decay phenotype varies among Coronaviruses,PRJNA901016;,"Extensive remodeling of host gene expression by coronaviruses nsp1 proteins is a well-documented and conserved aspect of coronavirus-host takeover. Using comparative transcriptomics we investigate the diversity of transcriptional targets between nsp1 proteins between α- and β- coronaviruses. Additionally, Affinity Purification Mass-Spectrometry was implemented to identify common and divergent interactors between the nsp1 proteins. While we detected widespread RNA destabilization between the different nsp1s, closely related nsp1 showed little similarities in clustering of targeted genes. Partial overlapping transcriptional targeting between α-CoV 229E and MERS nsp1 may suggest a shared similar targeting mechanism, as MERS nsp1 preferentially targets nuclear transcripts. Our interactome data shows great variance between nsp1 interactions, with 229E nsp1, the smallest tested here, interacts with the most host proteins, while MERS nsp1 only engaged with a few. While nsp1 is a rather well-conserved protein with consistent functions across different coronaviruses, its precise effects on host cells is virus-specific.

SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis mediated by E protein's PBM was prevented by modulators of CFTR function,PRJNA865787;,"The three human deadly coronaviruses (CoVs) (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) have infected around eight thousand, two thousand six hundred and 262 million people so far (December 2021), causing the death of 10%, 37% and 2% of them, respectively, so their implication in health is very important. These CoVs have proteins with a PBM motif that binds to PDZ cell domains. PDZ domains are found in more than 400 cellular proteins, therefore, viruses with PBM motifs have a high potential to modify cell behavior. It was studied the implication of the E protein PBM motif of various virulent or attenuated human CoVs (hCoVs) in the pathogenesis induced by these viruses. Variants of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that lack the E protein PBM have been generated by reverse genetics and their pathogenicity has been analyzed in mice. The PBM motifs of these three hCoVs have been shown to be virulence factors and participate in their replication. Furthermore, a collection of SARS-CoV mutants has been constructed in which the E protein PBM domain was replaced by the one derived from virulent or attenuated hCoVs, and their virulence was analyzed. A virulence gradient was observed, depending on whether the E protein PBM domain was derived from an attenuated or virulent hCoV. The gene expression patterns associated with the different PBM motifs in lungs of mice infected with SARS-CoV was analyzed by deep sequencing of the mRNAs expressed in lungs of infected mice, and it was observed that the E protein PBM motif of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates the expression of genes related to ion transport and cell homeostasis. Specifically, a decrease of the mRNA expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which is essential for edema resolution, was observed. The reduction of CFTR mRNA levels was associated with edema accumulation in lungs of mice infected with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The effect of compounds that modulate the expression and activity of CFTR on the pathogenesis and replication of SARS-CoV-2 was studied and it was observed that these compounds drastically reduced the production of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture and protect against SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

Homo sapiens,PRJDB11805,"Antigen presentation by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) on cell surfaces is critical for the transduction of the immune signal toward cytotoxic T lymphocytes. DNA damage upregulates HLA Class I presentation; however, the mechanism is unclear. Here, we show that DNA damage upregulates HLA presentation on the surface of normal and cancer cells. DNA damage-induced HLA (di-HLA) presentation requires PSMB8/9 and TAP1/2, demonstrating that antigen production is essential. Notably, depletion of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) components abolished di-HLA presentation. DNA damage reduced the expression of NMD transcripts in proliferative cells in an ATR-dependent manner, consistent with the requirement for ATR activity in di-HLA presentation, suggesting that DNA damage signaling stimulates the NMD process. Finally, in silico analysis identified that NMD-derived 9-mers bind to HLA and are immunogenic. Thus, our data suggest that DNA damage signaling produces immunogenic antigens by utilizing the machinery of RNA biogenesis without generating genomic mutations.Less...",

We wondered whether differentiated cell types might result from intrinsic differences in hiPS cells prior to the onset of differentiation. By associating individual differentiated cells that share a common hiPS cell precursor, we were able to test whether expression variability in differentiated cells was pre-determined from the hiPS cell state. Although within a single experiment, differentiated cells that share an hiPS cell progenitor were more transcriptionally similar to each other than to other cells in the differentiated population, when the same hiPS cells were differentiated in parallel, we did not observe high transcriptional similarity across differentiations.
Overall design: Single cell RNA sequencing (10X Genomics single-cell RNA-seq kit v3) of barcoded hiPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes and hiPS cells. hiPS cells were lentivirally transduced with barcode libraries consisting of random 100-mers in the 3’ untranslated region of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene after which they were permitted to divide approximately three times before being split and seeded for two parallel differentiations. On day 14 of differentiation (16 days after seeding), we used fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) gated for GFP positivity to enrich for barcode-containing cells on which we performed single cell RNA sequencing. As transcripts of the GFP transgene are captured by single cell RNA sequencing, we were also able to recover barcodes through a separate “side reaction” cDNA sequencing run and connect them to individual cells through analysis of GFP transcript 10x sequencing reads. Separately, we also transduced hiPS cells, allowed them to divide approximately six times before harvesting them for GFP sorting and sequencing.

"A synthetic control genome provides a universal molecular standard to measure DNA, mRNA and protein expression",PRJNA815898,"The phi X 174 bacteriophage was first sequenced in 1977, and has since become the most widely used standard in molecular biology and next-generation sequencing. However, with the advent of affordable DNA synthesis and de novo gene design, we considered whether we could engineer a synthetic genome, termed SynX, specifically tailored for use as a universal molecular standard. The SynX genome encodes 21 synthetic genes that can be in vitro transcribed to generate matched mRNA controls, and in vitro translated to generate matched protein controls. This enables the use of SynX as a matched control to compare across genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic experiments. The synthetic genes provide qualitative controls that measure sequencing accuracy across k-mers, GC-rich and repeat sequences, as well as act as quantitative controls that measure sensitivity and quantitative accuracy. We show how the SynX genome can measure DNA sequencing, evaluate gene expression in RNA sequencing experiments, or quantify proteins in mass spectrometry. Unlike previous spike-in controls, the SynX DNA, RNA and protein controls can be independently and sustainably prepared by recipient laboratories using common molecular biology techniques, and widely shared as a universal molecular standard.Less...",
Therapeutic efficacy of an oral nucleoside analog of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in mice,PRJNA815322,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains uncontrolled despite the rapid rollout of safe and effective severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines, underscoring the need to develop highly effective antivirals. In the setting of waning immunity from infection and vaccination, breakthrough infections are becoming increasingly common and treatment options remain limited. Additionally, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, with their potential to escape neutralization by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, emphasizes the need to develop second-generation oral antivirals targeting highly conserved viral proteins that can be rapidly deployed to outpatients. Here, we demonstrate the in vitro antiviral activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of GS-621763, an orally bioavailable prodrug of GS-441524, the parent nucleoside of remdesivir, which targets the highly conserved virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. GS-621763 exhibited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in lung cell lines and two different human primary lung cell culture systems. GS-621763 was also potently antiviral against a genetically unrelated emerging coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). The dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile observed after oral administration of GS-621763 translated to dose-dependent antiviral activity in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic GS-621763 administration reduced viral load and lung pathology; treatment also improved pulmonary function in COVID-19 mouse model. A direct comparison of GS-621763 with molnupiravir, an oral nucleoside analog antiviral currently in human clinical trial , proved both drugs to be similarly efficacious in mice.

"Bidirectional genome-wide CRISPR screens reveal host factors regulating SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and seasonal HCoVs",PRJNA798057;,"Several genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens have been conducted to identify host factors regulating SARS-CoV-2 replication, but the models used have often relied on overexpression of ACE2 receptor and didn’t express TMPRSS2 protease, known to be important for viral entry at the plasma membrane. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of these screens and showed a high level of cell-type specificity of the identified hits, arguing for the necessity to pursue efforts to uncover the full landscape of SARS-CoV-2 regulators. We performed genome-wide, bidirectional CRISPR screens in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, as well as knockout screens in Caco-2 intestinal cells. As well as identifying ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as top hits, our study reveals a series of so far unidentified and critical host-dependency factors, including the Adaptins AP1G1 and AP1B1 and the flippase ATP8B1. Additionally, new anti-SARS-CoV-2 proteins with potent activity, including several membrane-associated Mucins (MUC1, MUC4 and MUC21), IL6R and CD44 were identified . We further observed that these genes mostly acted at the critical step of viral entry, with the notable exception of ATP8B1, the knockout of which prevented late stages of viral replication. Exploring the pro- and anti-viral breadth of these genes using highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, seasonal HCoV-NL63 and -229E and influenza A virus, we reveal that some genes such as AP1G1 and ATP8B1 are general coronavirus cofactors. In contrast, Mucins recapitulated their known role as a general antiviral defense mechanism. These results demonstrate the value of considering multiple cell models and perturbational modalities for understanding SARS-CoV-2 replication and provide a list of potential new targets for therapeutic interventions.

Presence of recombinant bat coronavirus in Cambodian bats,PRJNA795576,"Bats have been recognized as an exceptional viral reservoir, especially for coronaviruses. At least three bat zoonotic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) have been shown to cause severe diseases in humans and it is expected more will emerge. One of the major features of CoVs is that they are all highly prone to recombination. An extreme example is the insertion of the P10 gene from reoviruses in the bat CoV GCCDC1, first discovered in Rousettus leschenaultii bats in China. Here, we report the detection of GCCDC1 in four different bat species (Eonycteris spelaea, Cynopterus sphinx, Rhinolophus shameli and Rousettus sp.) in Cambodia. This finding demonstrates a much broader geographic and bat species range for this virus and indicates common cross-species transmission. Interestingly, one of the bat samples showed a co-infection with an Alpha CoV most closely related to RsYN14, a virus recently discovered in the same genus (Rhinolophus) of bat in Yunan, China, 2020.

SARS-CoV-2 diverges from other betacoronaviruses in only partially activating the IRE1a/XBP1 ER stress pathway in human lung-derived cells,PRJNA795179;,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has killed over 6 million individuals worldwide and continues to spread in countries where vaccines are not yet widely available, or its citizens are hesitant to become vaccinated. Therefore, it is critical to unravel the molecular mechanisms that allow SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses to infect and overtake the host machinery of human cells. Coronavirus replication triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a key host cell pathway widely believed essential for viral replication. We examined the master UPR sensor IRE1a kinase/RNase and its downstream transcription factor effector XBP1s, which is processed through an IRE1a-mediated mRNA splicing event, in human lung-derived cells infected with betacoronaviruses. We found human respiratory coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and murine coronavirus (MHV) all induce ER stress and strongly trigger the kinase and RNase activities of IRE1a as well as XBP1 splicing. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 only partially activates IRE1a through autophosphorylation, but its RNase activity fails to splice XBP1. Moreover, while IRE1a was dispensable for replication in human cells for all coronaviruses tested, it was required for maximal expression of genes associated with several key cellular functions, including the interferon signaling pathway, during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 actively inhibits the RNase of autophosphorylated IRE1a, perhaps as a strategy to eliminate detection by the host immune system.
Overall design: A549 cells expressing the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 were cultured in 10% FBS RPMI media. At 70% cell confluence, cells were washed once with PBS before being mock infected or infected with MERS-CoV (EMC/2012) at MOI = 1. Virus was absorbed for 1 hour at 37 degrees Celsius in serum-free RPMI media. After one hour, virus was removed, cells washed three times with PBS, and 2% FBS RPMI was added. The cells were incubated for another 24 hours or 36 hours, then washed once with PBS and lysed using RLT Plus lysis buffer before genomic DNA removal and total RNA extraction using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen 74134). Three independent biological replicates were performed per experimental condition. RNA sample quality check, library construction, and sequencing were performed by GeneWiz following standard protocols. All samples were sequenced by an Illumina HiSeq sequencer to generate paired-end 150bp reads. Read quality was assessed using FastQC v0.11.2 as described by Andrews, S. (2010) “FastQC:  A Quality Control Tool for High Throughput Sequence Data” (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Raw sequencing reads from each sample were quality and adapter trimmed using BBDuk 38.73 as described by Bushnell, B at ""BBTools software package"" (http://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap). The reads were mapped to the human genome (hg38 with Ensembl V98 annotation) using RNA STAR 2.7.1a. The resulting BAM files were counted by featureCounts 1.6.4 to count the number of reads for each gene.
For SARS-CoV-2 and OC43 infections, ACE2-A549 control or IRE1 KO cells were cultured in 10% FBS RPMI to 70% confluence. Cells were washed once with PBS before being mock infected or infected with each virus at MOI = 1 for one hour in serum-free RPMI at 33C. Cells were then washed three times with PBS before 2% FBS RPMI was added.

RespiCoV,PRJEB49379,"Since December 2019 the world has been facing the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Identification of infected patients and discrimination from other respiratory infections have so far been accomplished by using highly specific real-time PCRs. Here we present a rapid multiplex approach (RespiCoV), combining highly multiplexed PCRs and MinION sequencing suitable for the simultaneous screening for 40 viral and five bacterial agents related to respiratory tract infections, including the human coronaviruses NL63, HKU1, OC43, 229E, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. RespiCoV was applied to 150 patient samples with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared with specific real-time PCR. Additionally, several respiratory tract pathogens were identified in samples tested positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2. Finally, RespiCoV was experimentally compared to the commercial RespiFinder 2SMART multiplex screening assay (PathoFinder, The Netherlands).Less...",

A genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies interactors of the autophagy pathway as conserved coronavirus targets,PRJNA779941,"Here we conducted two independent genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens to identify MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E host dependency factors (HDF) required for HCoV replication in the human Huh7 cell line. Top scoring genes were further validated and assessed in the context of MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E infection as well as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Strikingly, we found that several autophagy-related genes, including TMEM41B, MINAR1, and the immunophilin FKBP8, were common host factors required for pan-CoV replication. Importantly, inhibition of the immunophilin protein family with the compounds cyclosporine A and the non-immunosuppressive derivative alisporivir, resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of CoV replication in primary human nasal epithelial cell cultures, which recapitulate the natural site of virus replication. Overall, we identified host factors that are crucial for CoV replication and demonstrated that these factors constitute potential targets for therapeutic intervention by clinically approved drugs.Less...",
The N-terminal Region of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Accessory Protein 8b is Essential for Enhanced Virulence of an Attenuated Murine Coronavirus,PRJNA779153;,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a beta coronavirus that emerged in 2012, causing severe pneumonia and renal failure. MERS-CoV encodes five accessory proteins. Some of them have been shown to interfere with host antiviral immune response. However, the roles of protein 8b in innate immunity and viral virulence was rarely studied. Here, we introduced individual MERS-CoV accessory protein genes into the genome of an attenuated murine coronavirus (Mouse hepatitis virus, MHV), respectively and found accessory protein 8b could enhance viral replication in vivo and in vitro, and increase the lethality of infected mice. RNA-seq analysis revealed that protein 8b could significantly inhibit type I interferon production (IFN-I) and innate immune response in mice infected with MHV expressing protein 8b. We also found that MERS-CoV protein 8b could initiate from multiple internal methionine sites and at least three protein variants were identified. Residues 1-23 of protein 8b was demonstrated to be responsible for increased virulence in vivo. In addition, the inhibitory effect on IFN-I of protein 8b might not contribute to its virulence enhancement as aa1-23 deletion did not affect IFN-I production in vitro and in vivo. Next, we also found that protein 8b was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi membrane in infected cells, which was disrupted by C-terminal region aa 88-112 deletion. This study will provide new insight into the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection.

Deciphering COVID-19 host transcriptomic complexity and variations for therapeutic discovery against new variants,PRJNA777558;,"COVID-19 has infected 244 million people globally and evolved several variants with higher infectivity. Drug repurposing could be an efficient and timely means of drug discovery for the pandemic. To date, more than two hundred repurposed SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors have been reported but with moderate efficacy or acute toxicity. Thus, there is a great need to find new effective candidates against SARS-CoV-2, especially the new variants, with good safety profiles. We analyzed 17 hundred published host RNA-seq samples of SARS/MERS/SARS-CoV-2 infection derived from pre-clinical models or patients, together with the reported coronavirus inhibitors to summarize a robust coronavirus-induced host gene expression change signature, which captured biological processes involved in host cell machinery hijacking and immune evasion. Then we searched for drugs potently reversing the infection signature and discovered IMD-0354 as a promising candidate with nanomolar IC50 against SARS-CoV-2 and 6 variants, showing a wide therapeutic window of more than 100-fold. The RNA-seq of IMD-0354 treated cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 reaved that this drug could stimulate type I interferon antiviral response, inhibit viral entry and down-regulate hijacked proteins. This work demonstrated the power of biological big data and the efficiency of a system-based drug discovery approach, which can be used in future pandemic.
Overall design: we setup three sets of experiments including control, SARS-CoV-2 infection and IMD-0354 treatment followed by SARS-CoV-2 infection in Calu-3 cells. RNA was isolated from each replicate using KAPA RNA HyperPrep Kit as per manufacturer instructions. Total RNA was processed further using the Ribominus kit to remove the ribosomal RNAs.

Short duplex RNAs induce potent immunostimulation via Hoogsteen G-G base pairing-mediated dimerization,PRJNA753532;,"Here we describe a new class of immunostimulatory short duplex RNAs that potently induce production of type I interferon (IFN-I), and particularly IFN-β, in a wide range of human cell types via end-to-end dimerization, direct binding to RIG-I, and activation of the RIG-I/IRF3  pathway. These RNAs require a minimum of 20 base pairs, lack any sequence or structural  characteristics of known immunostimulatory RNAs, and instead require a unique conserved  sequence motif (sense strand: 5’-C, antisense strand: 3’-GGG) that mediates the self-assembly  of end-to-end RNA dimers by Hoogsteen G-G base-pairing. The presence of terminal hydroxyl  or monophosphate groups, blunt or overhanging ends, or terminal RNA or DNA bases also did  not affect their ability to induce IFN-I production. Immune stimulation mediated by these duplex  RNAs results in broad spectrum inhibition of infections by many respiratory viruses with  pandemic potential, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza A, as well  as the common cold virus HCoV-NL63 in cell lines and in human Lung Chips that mimic organlevel  lung pathophysiology. These novel immunostimulatory motifs potentially could be  harnessed to create broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics, but they should be avoided when  designing siRNAs to minimize immunological side effects.

Effects of sequence motifs in the yeast 3' untranslated region determined from massively-parallel assays of random sequences,PRJNA750726,"The 3' untranslated region (UTR) plays critical roles in determining the level of gene expression, through effects on activities such as mRNA stability and translation. The underlying functional elements within this region have largely been identified through analyses of the limited number of native genes. To explore the effects of sequence elements when not present in biologically evolved sequence backgrounds, we analyzed hundreds of thousands of random 50-mers inserted into the 3' UTR of a reporter gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We determined relative protein expression levels from the fitness of a library of transformants in a growth selection. We find that the consensus 3' UTR efficiency element significantly boosts expression, independent of sequence context; on the other hand, the consensus positioning element has only a small effect on expression. Some sequence motifs that are binding sites for Puf proteins substantially increase expression in this random library, despite these proteins generally being associated with post-transcriptional downregulation when bound to native mRNAs. Thus, the regulatory effects of 3' UTR sequence features like the positioning element and Puf binding sites appear to be strongly dependent on their context within native genes, where they exist alongside co-evolved sequence features. Our measurements also allowed a systematic examination of the effects of point mutations within efficiency element motifs across diverse sequence backgrounds. These mutational scans reveal the relative in vivo importance of individual bases in the efficiency element, which likely reflects their roles in binding the Hrp1 protein involved in cleavage and polyadenylation.Less...",
"DNA Binding Specificities of Fkh1, Fkh2, Hcm1, and Fhl1 Revealed by SELEX-seq",PRJNA741127;,"Quantifying the preferences of DNA binding proteins is an essential step in determining how transcription factors (TFs) interact with their targets in the genome. High-throughput in vitro binding assays have been used to identify the inherent DNA preferences of TFs in a controlled environment isolated from confounding factors such as genome accessibility, DNA methylation, and TF binding cooperativity. Unfortunately, the limited variable region or sequencing depth typically utilized by many of the available experimental approaches makes it difficult to measure the preferences of moderate- to low-affinity binding sites, and impossible to measure small-scale differences between closely related homologs. The Forkhead box (FOX) family of TFs is known to play a crucial role in regulating a variety of key processes from proliferation and development, to tumor suppression and aging. By using the high-sequencing depth SELEX-seq approach to study all four FOX homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have been able to precisely quantify the contribution and importance of nucleotide positions flanking the core of the binding sites. Essential to this process was the alignment of our SELEX-seq reads to a set of candidate core sequences determined by two newly developed strategies of alignment and reprioritization applied to enriched k-mers.
Overall design: SELEX-seq was performed on Fkh1, Fkh2, Hcm1, and Fhl1 constructs as described in Cooper et al. (to be submitted). We provide sequencing results for both the intial library (R0) as well as the selected libraries after one (R1) or two (R2) rounds of selection. A test experiment was performed using just the Fkh1 construct with a shallower depth of sequencing. The final, large-scale experiments were performed on both all constructs. The initial libraries included a 16 bp randomized region flanked by two fixed adapters absent of any known binding site for the used transcription factors.Less...",GSE178811
"Bidirectional genome-wide CRISPR screens reveal host factors regulating SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and seasonal HCoVs",PRJNA733168;,"Several genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens have been conducted to identify host factors regulating SARS-CoV-2 replication, but the models used have often relied on overexpression of ACE2 receptor and didn’t express TMPRSS2 protease, known to be important for viral entry at the plasma membrane. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of these screens and showed a high level of cell-type specificity of the identified hits, arguing for the necessity to pursue efforts to uncover the full landscape of SARS-CoV-2 regulators. We performed genome-wide, bidirectional CRISPR screens in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, as well as knockout screens in Caco-2 intestinal cells. As well as identifying ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as top hits, our study reveals a series of so far unidentified and critical host-dependency factors, including the Adaptins AP1G1 and AP1B1 and the flippase ATP8B1. Additionally, new anti-SARS-CoV-2 proteins with potent activity, including several membrane-associated Mucins (MUC1, MUC4 and MUC21), IL6R and CD44 were identified . We further observed that these genes mostly acted at the critical step of viral entry, with the notable exception of ATP8B1, the knockout of which prevented late stages of viral replication. Exploring the pro- and anti-viral breadth of these genes using highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, seasonal HCoV-NL63 and -229E and influenza A virus, we reveal that some genes such as AP1G1 and ATP8B1 are general coronavirus cofactors. In contrast, Mucins recapitulated their known role as a general antiviral defense mechanism. These results demonstrate the value of considering multiple cell models and perturbational modalities for understanding SARS-CoV-2 replication and provide a list of potential new targets for therapeutic interventions.

Amaranthus palmeri sex chromosome evolution,PRJEB38372,"Dioecy, the separation of reproductive organs on different individuals, has evolved repeatedly in different plant families.Several evolutionary paths to dioecy have been suggested, but the mechanisms behind sex determination is not well understood.\textit{A. palmeri} represents a unique model system to study sex determination in plants, as dioecy is rare among successful colonizers.In addtion, \textit{A. palmeri} is one of the most troublesome weeds in the US and has evolved resistance to several herbicide classes and also successfully colonized other regions in the world. Early cytogenetic experiments did not identify heteromorphic chromosomes and the sex determining system in \textit{A. palmeri} has remained unknown.We used whole genome sequencing of male and female pools from two independent populations to elucidate the genetic control of dioecy in \textit{Amaranthus palmeri}.Read alignment to a close monoecious relative and allele frequency comparisons between male and female pools did not reveal significant sex linked genes.Consequently we employed an alignment free k-mer comparison which enabled us to identify a large number of male specific k-mers. We assembled male specific contigs comprising a total of almost 2 Mb sequence, proposing a XY sex determination system in the species. Based on our findings we suggest an intermediate evolutionary state of dioecy in \textit{A. palmeri}.

coronaviruses in bats from Guinea,PRJEB38748,"Zoonoses represent 60% of emerging infectious diseases and constitute a threat for public health than can have a global importance, as seen with the current pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. Bats have been recognized as an important source of zoonotic viruses, and harbor a wide diversity of coronaviruses (CoVs). In West Africa, where there is a high diversity of bat species, a few is known on the circulation of coronaviruses in these hosts, especially at the interface with human populations. Thus, it is important to expand our knowledge of the presence of CoVs in bats which may represent a risk to humans. In this study in Guinea, we tested a total of 634 swabs and feces samples from 319 individuals belonging to 14 genera and 6 families of insectivorous and frugivorous bats across the country, for the presence of coronaviruses using a broadly reactive Reverse Transcription PCR assay. We found CoVs in 35 (11%) of the tested bats, in 3 insectivorous bat species belonging to 3 families (i.e. Hipposideridae, Rhinolophidae and Nycteridae) and 5 fruit bat species (Eidolon helvum, Rousettus aegyptiacus, Lissonycteris angolensis, Epomophorus gambianus, Nanonycteris sp.). Positivity rates varied from 5.7% to 100% depending on bat species, and a wide diversity of alpha and beta coronaviruses was found among the obtained sequences. This includes 3 sequences from insectivorous bats (Hipposideros sp. and Nycteris sp.) that clustered with ßCoVs from the sub-genera of SarbeCoVs and MerbeCoVs, known to harbor the highy pathogenic human coronaviruses SARS-CoVs and MERS-CoVs respectively. We also report for the fisrt time, infection in a Nanonycteris bat and a co-infection with α and ßCov in a frugivorous bat (R. aegyptiacus). This pilot study described a large diversity found in 13 of the 14 collection sites across the country suggesting that CoVs are widely spread in West Africa and their circulation should be assessed. This is even more relevant that positive bats were mostly captured (72%) close to human habitats, showing the importance of larger studies on the characterization of CoVs and to evaluate the risk of exposure of potential zoonotic CoVs to humans.Less...",
Clofazimine is a broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor that antagonizes SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human cell culture and hamsters,PRJNA683662;,"COVID-19 is the third outbreak of zoonotic coronavirus (CoV) of the century after the epidemic Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) in 2012. Treatment options for CoVs are largely lacking. Here, we show that clofazimine, an anti-leprosy drug with favorable safety and pharmacokinetics profile, possesses pan-coronaviral inhibitory activity, and can antagonize SARS-CoV-2 replication in multiple in vitro systems, including the human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and ex vivo lung cultures. The FDA-approved molecule was found to inhibit multiple steps of viral replication, suggesting polypharmacology is likely underlying its antiviral activity. In a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, prophylactic and therapeutic administration of clofazimine significantly reduced lung viral load and fecal viral shedding, as well as reversal of cytokine storm. Additionally, clofazimine exhibited antiviral drug synergy when administered with remdesivir. Since clofazimine is orally bioavailable and has a comparatively low manufacturing cost, it is an attractive clinical candidate for outpatient treatment and remdesivir-based combinatorial therapy for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, particularly in developing countries. Taken together, our data provide evidence that clofazimine may prove effective against current pandemic SARS-CoV-2, endemic MERS-CoV in the Middle East, and, possibly most importantly, emerging CoV of the future.
Overall design: For experiment on Caco-2 cells, cells were infected with or without SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=4) and treated with clofazimine (10 µM) or DMSO vehicle control for 3hours or 6 hours.

A novel cell culture system modeling the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle,PRJNA682433;,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the global pandemic of COVID-19, and no effective antiviral agents and vaccines are available. SARS-CoV-2 is classified as a biosafety level-3 (BLS-3) agent, impeding the basic research into its biology and the development of effective antivirals. Here, we described a safe cell culture system for production of transcription and replication-competent, biologically contained SARS-CoV-2 virus like particles (trVLP) that express a reporter gene (GFP) replacing viral nucleocapsid gene, which is required for viral genome packaging and virion assembly (SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N trVLP). The complete viral life cycle can be exclusively achieved and confined in the cells expressing SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 N proteins in trans, but not MERS-CoV N. Additionally, genetic recombination of N supplied in trans into viral genome was not detected, as evidenced by sequence analysis after one-month serial passages in N-expressing Caco-2 cells. Moreover, Intein-mediated protein trans-splicing approach was utilized to split the viral N gene into two independent vectors, and the ligated viral N protein could function in trans to recapitulate entire viral life cycle, further securing the biosafety of this cell culture model. To prove the suitability of this system in antivirals discovery, we developed a 96-well format high throughput screening to identify salinomycin, monensin sodium and lycorine chloride exhibiting potent antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, we propose that this cell culture system based on Intein-N genetic complementation to produce SARS-CoV-2 trVLP provides a safe means to dissect the virus life cycle, and thus accelerate our understanding of virus biology, as well as for more applied uses such as the screening and development of novel antivirals, and thus represent powerful tools for SARS-CoV-2 study.

WGS CoSSA,PRJEB39668,"Standard strategies to identify genomic regions involved in a specific trait variation are often limited by time and resource consuming genotyping methods. Other limiting pre-requisites are the phenotyping of large segregating populations or of diversity panels and the availability and quality of a closely related reference genome. To overcome these limitations, we designed efficient Comparative Subsequence Sets Analysis (CoSSA) workflows to identify haplotype specific SNPs linked to a trait of interest from Whole Genome Sequencing data.
      As a model, we used the resistance to Synchytrium endobioticum pathotypes 2, 6 and 18 that co-segregated in a tetraploid full sib population. Genomic DNA from both parents, pedigree genotypes, unrelated potato varieties lacking the wart resistance traits and pools of resistant and susceptible siblings were sequenced. Set algebra and depth filtering of subsequences (k-mers) were used to delete unlinked and common SNPs and to enrich for SNPs from the haplotype(s) harboring the resistance gene(s). Using CoSSA, we identified a major and a minor effect locus. Upon comparison to the reference genome, it was inferred that the major resistance locus, referred to as Sen3, was located on the north arm of chromosome 11 between 1,259,552 and 1,519,485 bp. Furthermore, we could anchor the unanchored superscaffold DMB734 from the potato reference genome to a synthenous interval. CoSSA was also successful in identifying Sen3 in a reference genome independent way thanks to the de novo assembly of paired end reads matching haplotype specific k-mers. The de novo assembly provided more R haplotype specific polymorphisms than the reference genome corresponding region. CoSSA also offers possibilities for pedigree analysis. The origin of Sen3 was traced back until Ora. Finally, the diagnostic power of the haplotype specific markers was shown using a panel of 56 tetraploid varieties.
      CoSSA is an efficient, robust and versatile set of workflows for the genetic analysis of a trait of interest using WGS data. Because the WGS data are used without intermediate reads mapping, CoSSA does not require the use of a reference genome. This approach allowed the identification of Sen3 and the design of haplotype specific, diagnostic markers.Less...",

Comparative analysis of coronavirus genomic RNA structure reveals conservation in SARS-like coronaviruses,PRJNA659362,"This work provides the first genome-wide analysis of RNA secondary structure in any coronavirus by defining highly stable RNA structures across the entire genomes of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The analyses suggest provocative new insights into the role(s) of RNA structure in viral replication and evolution. Importantly, it finds that the SARS-like coronaviruses contain multiple conserved novel RNA structures, even in areas of low sequence conservation, suggesting important functions in coronavirus replication and pathogenesis. It also finds that nucleotide variation between sequenced isolates of SARS-CoV-2 is lower in structured regions, and that highly variable nucleotides in structured regions occur at nucleotides that do not impact highly stable RNA structures, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is under selective pressure to maintain these RNA structures. Known RNA secondary structures play critical roles in multiple aspects of coronavirus replication, but the extent and conservation of RNA secondary structure across coronavirus genomes was previously unknown. The results provide the first full genome analysis of RNA structure in any coronavirus, and show that highly stable RNA structures are common, and widely distributed throughout the genome. Identifying the full complement of RNA secondary structures in the MERS, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genomes, provides scientists with essential information for determining how RNA structure drives viral pathogenesis. The comparative approach together with the analysis of sequence conservation and nucleotide variability provides a new way to identify functionally important RNA structures, and prioritize future studies. There is an urgent need to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapeutics. Targeted disruption of RNA structures conserved in SARS-like coronaviruses could provide a safety feature to prevent vaccine-associated disease, or limit the reversion potential of live attenuated vaccine strains. Several groups are pursuing small molecule or RNA-based approaches to limit SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis. The results will facilitate these efforts by identifying targets for these therapeutic. The results thus enable multiple approaches to the development of SARS-CoV-2 therapetuics.Less...",
Transcriptomic profiling of human corona virus (HCoV)-229E -infected human cells,PRJNA656274;,"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause mild to severe respiratory infection. Most of the common cold illnesses are caused by one of four HCoVs, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. Several studies have applied global transcriptomic methods to understand host responses to HCoV infection, with most studies focusing on the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2. In this study, Next Generation Sequencing was used to gain new insights into cellular transcriptomic changes elicited by alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E. HCoV-229E-infected MRC5 cells showed marked downregulation of superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis and eIF2 signaling pathways. Moreover, upregulation of cyclins, cell cycle control of chromosomal replication, and role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, alongside downregulation of the cell cycle G1/S checkpoint, suggest that HCoV-229E favors S phase for viral infection. Intriguingly, more than 80% of key factors of cell innate immunity, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and other transcripts of early antiviral response genes were downregulated early in HCoV-229E infection. This study will enhance our understanding of commonly circulating HCoVs and hopefully provide critical information about still-emerging coronaviruses.
Overall design: a 24-hour culture to 80-90% confluency, cells were infected with 0.01 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of HCoV-229E  virus. Total RNA was extracted at 0, 6, 24, 48 and 72 post-HCoV-229E infection. At each time point, three biological repeats were tested.Less...",GSE155986
SARS-CoV-2 infection is effectively treated and prevented by EIDD-2801,PRJNA649246;,"All coronaviruses known to have recently emerged as human pathogens probably originated in bats1. Here we use a single experimental platform based on immunodeficient mice implanted with human lung tissue (hereafter, human lung-only mice (LoM)) to demonstrate the efficient in vivo replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as two endogenous SARS-like bat coronaviruses that show potential for emergence as human pathogens. Virus replication in this model occurs in bona fide human lung tissue and does not require any type of adaptation of the virus or the host. Our results indicate that bats contain endogenous coronaviruses that are capable of direct transmission to humans. Our detailed analysis of in vivo infection with SARS-CoV-2 in human lung tissue from LoM showed a predominant infection of human lung epithelial cells, including type-2 pneumocytes that are present in alveoli and ciliated airway cells. Acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 was highly cytopathic and induced a robust and sustained type-I interferon and inflammatory cytokine and chemokine response. Finally, we evaluated a therapeutic and pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results show that therapeutic and prophylactic administration of EIDD-2801?an oral broad-spectrum antiviral agent that is currently in phase II/III clinical trials?markedly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in vivo, and thus has considerable potential for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
Overall design: Human lung-only mice (LoM) were used as an in vivo model to evaluate infection of lung tissue with recombinant coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 as well as full length bat coronaviruses WIV1 and SHC014 (12, 13, 35, 36).

The short- and long-range RNA Interactome of SARS-CoV-2,PRJNA646969;,"The Coronaviridae are a family of positive- strand RNA viruses that includes SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bearing the largest single stranded RNA genome in nature, coronaviruses are critically dependent on long-distance RNA-RNA interactions to regulate the viral transcription and replication pathways. Here we experimentally mapped the in vivo long-range RNA interactome of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome and the subgenomic mRNAs. We uncover a network of RNA-RNA interactions spanning tens of thousands of nucleotides that facilitate the unique transcription mode of coronaviruses, and reveal that the viral genome adopts alternative topologies inside cells and undergoes genome cyclization. Moreover, we discover long RNA-bridges between adjacent open reading frames that encircle the programmed ribosomal frame-shifting element, and demonstrate their conservation in vivo for the related MERS-CoV. Finally, the SARS-CoV-2 genome and subgenomic mRNAs engage in different sets of interactions with cellular RNAs. Our findings illuminate RNA-based mechanisms governing replication, discontinuous transcription, and translation of coronaviruses, and will aid future efforts to develop antiviral strategies.
Overall design: We recently developed Crosslinking Of Matched RNAs And Deep Sequencing (COMRADES) for in-depth RNA conformation capture in living cells (Ziv et al., 2018). COMRADES can detect base-paired regions in RNA inside the cell,  using a clickable psoralen derivative to specifically crosslink double-stranded RNA, and high throughput sequencing to retrieve the base-pairing information (Figure S1A). Following in vivo crosslinking, the viral RNA is selectively captured, fragmented and subjected to a click-chemistry reaction to add a biotin tag to crosslinked regions. Crosslinked RNA duplexes are then selectively captured using streptavidin affinity purification. Half of the resulting RNA is proximity ligated, following reversal of the crosslink to create chimeric RNA templates for high throughput sequencing. The other half is used as a control, in which reversal of the crosslink precedes the proximity ligation, and accurately represents the background level of non-specific ligation. The coupling of two enrichment steps, first of viral RNA, and second of crosslinked RNA duplexes provides high structural depth for identification of both long- and short-lived conformations. COMRADES can therefore measure (i) the structural diversity of alternative RNA conformations that coexist inside cells; (ii) short-distance, as well as long-distance (over tens of thousands of nucleotides) base-pairing within the same RNA molecule; and (iii) base-pairing between different RNA molecules, such as those of host and viral origin (Kudla et al., 2020; Ziv et al., 2018).

Rat QTL Analysis,PRJEB38096,"Little is known about the impact of naturally occurring genetic variation on the rates with which proteins are synthesized by ribosomes. Here, we investigate how genetic influences on mRNA translational efficiency are associated with complex disease phenotypes using a panel of rat recombinant inbred lines. We identify a locus for cardiac hypertrophy that is associated with a translatome-wide and protein length-dependent shift in translational efficiency. This master regulator primarily affects the translation of very short and very long protein-coding sequences, altering the physiological stoichiometric translation rates of sarcomere proteins. Mechanistic dissection of this locus points to altered ribosome assembly, characterized by accumulation of polysome half-mers, changed ribosomal configurations and misregulation of the small nucleolar RNA SNORA48. We postulate that this locus enhances a pre-existing negative correlation between protein length and translation initiation in diseased hearts. Our work shows that a single genomic locus can trigger a complex, translation-driven molecular mechanism that contributes to phenotypic variability between individuals.Less...",

Identification and characterization of centromeric sequences in Xenopus laevis,PRJNA641345;,"Centromeres play an essential role in cell division by specifying the site of kinetochore formation on each chromosome so that chromosomes can attach to the mitotic spindle for segregation. Centromeres are defined epigenetically by the histone  H3 variant CEntromere Protein A (CENP-A). Dividing cells maintain the centromere  by depositing new CENP-A each cell cycle to replenish CENP-A diluted by replication. The CENP-A nucleosome serves as the primary signal to the machinery responsible for its replenishment. Vertebrate centromeres are frequently built on repetitive sequences organized in tandem arrays. Repetitive centromeric DNA has been suggested to play a role in centromere maintenance and in de novo centromere formation, but this has been difficult to dissect because of the difficulty in manipulating centromere in cells. Extracts from Xenopus laevis eggs are able to assemble centromeres and kinetochores in vitro and thus provide a useful system for studying the role of centromeric DNA in centromere formation. However centromeric sequences in X. laevis have not been extensively characterized.. In this study we characterize repeat sequences found at  X. laevis centromeres. We utilize a k-mer based approach in order to uncover the previously unknown diversity of X. laevis centromeric sequences. We validate centromere localization of repeat sequences by in situ hybridization and identify the location of the centromeric repetitive array on each chromosome by mapping the distribution of centromere enriched k-mers on the Xenopus genome. Our identification of X. laevis centromere sequences enables previously unapproachable genomic studies of centromeres. The k-mer based approach that we used to investigate centromeric repetitive DNA is suitable for the analysis of other repetitive sequences found across the genome or the study of repeats in other organisms.

Experimental and natural evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced activation of type I interferon responses,PRJNA636173;,"Two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have evolved proteins that can inhibit host antiviral responses, likely contributing to disease progression and high case-fatality rates. SARS-CoV-2 emerged in December 2019 to cause a global pandemic. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is unable to induce a robust type I interferon (IFN) response in human cells, leading to speculations about the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to inhibit innate antiviral responses. However, innate antiviral responses are dynamic in nature and gene expression levels rapidly change within minutes to hours. In this study, we have performed a time series RNA-seq analysis to identify early virus-host processes. SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulated transcripts for type I IFNs and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) after 12 hours. Furthermore, we analyzed the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to inhibit type I IFN production and downstream antiviral signaling in human cells. Using exogenous stimuli, we discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is unable to modulate IFNb production and downstream expression of ISGs, such as IRF7 and IFIT1. Thus, data from our study indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved additional mechanisms, such as masking its nucleic acid from cellular immune response sensors to mount a dampened innate antiviral response. Further studies are required to fully identify the range of immune-modulatory strategies of SARS-CoV-2.

Attenuation of SARS-CoV-2 Infection by Losartan in Human Kidney Organoids,PRJNA629682;,"COVID-19 associated acute kidney injury (COVID-AKI) is a common complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized patients. It is unclear how susceptible human kidneys are to direct SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether pharmacologic manipulation of the renin-angiotensin II signaling (RAS) pathway modulates this susceptibility. Using induced pluripotent stem cell derived kidney organoids, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV tropism, defined by the paired expression of a host receptor (ACE2, NRP1 or DPP4) and protease (TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, FURIN, CTSB or CTSL), was identified primarily amongst proximal tubule cells. Losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker being tested in COVID-19 patients, inhibited angiotensin II mediated internalization of ACE2, upregulated interferon stimulated genes (IFITM1 and BST2) known to restrict viral entry, and attenuated the infection of proximal tubule cells by SARS-CoV-2. Our work highlights the susceptibility of proximal tubule cells to SARS-CoV-2 and reveals a putative protective role for RAS inhibitors during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Overall design: Cell Lines:
Human iPSC lines were purchased from Gibco (human episomal iPSC line, Cat. #A18944-derived from neonate female umbilical cord blood) or were derived from cryopreserved human dermal fibroblast (Cell Applications, Inc.

Vero E6 cells (ATCC, Cat. #C1008) were maintained in a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO2 and cultured in DMEM (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher, Cat. #10378-016; herein referred to as 1% PSQ) and 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Thermo Fisher; herein referred to as complete DMEM).
Generation of kidney organoids:
Kidney organoids were differentiated using the Takasato protocol with minor modifications51 that included APEL2 medium (Stem Cell Technologies, Cat. #05275) supplemented with 5% PFHM-II (Thermo Fisher, Cat. #12040077) (APEL2 + PFHM) in replacement of APEL. Induced PSCs were grown on a feeder-free system using Matrigel matrix coated plates. Cells were treated with 8 µM CHIR99021 (R&D Systems, Cat. #4423) for 4 days followed by recombinant human FGF-9 (200 ng/mL) and heparin (1 μg/mL) for an additional 3 days. At day 7, cells were dissociated into single cell suspension using trypsin-EDTA (0.05%) for 2 min and 250,000 or 500,000 cells were centrifuged to make a pellet at 400 x g for 2 min. The pellet was transferred onto a six-well transwell plate (Corning, Cat. # 07-200-170) with four or nine pellets per well, respectively. Pellets were incubated with a pulse of 5 µM CHIR99021 in APEL2 + PFHM medium for 1 hr at 37 °C.

Organoids were dissociated to single cells using TrypLE Select (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C with mechanical trituration. Single cell suspensions were visually inspected under a microscope, counted using an automated hand-held cell counter (Millipore Scepter™ 2.0 Cell Counter), and resuspended at a concentration of 15,000 single-cells in 50 microliters of FACS buffer (0.1% BSA–PBS). All four samples were processed according to 10X Genomics ChromiumTM Next GEM Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits v3.1 as per manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, single cells were partitioned together with barcoded Gel Bead-In-EMulsions (GEMs) using 10x GemCodeTM Technology. This process lysed cells and enabled barcoded reverse transcription of RNA, generating cDNA from poly-adenylated mRNA. DynaBeads® MyOneTM Silane magnetic beads were used to remove leftover biochemical reagents, then cDNA was amplified by PCR. Quality control size gating was used to select cDNA amplicon size prior to library construction. Read 1 primer sequences were added to cDNA during GEM incubation. P5 primers, P7 primers, i7 sample index, and Read 2 primer sequences were added during library construction. Quality control and cDNA quantification was performed using Agilent D1000 ScreenTape System. Libraries were pooled and first sequenced on NovaSeq 100 (plus 25 additional) Cycle SP dual lane flow cell to approximate the number of recovered cells in each sample. We recovered 4,235 cells in Control, 5,702 cells in losartan-alone, 5,800 cells in angiotensin II alone, and 5,855 cells in angiotensin II plus losartan treated groups with an estimated doublet rate of ≈4%.

Self-compatibility in diploid potatoes,PRJEB36551,"Self-compatible (SC) diploid potatoes allow innovative potato breeding. Therefore, the Sli gene, originally described in S. chacoense, has received much attention. In elite S. tuberosum diploids, spontaneous berry set is occasionally observed.  We aimed to map SC from S. tuberosum origin. Two full-sib mapping populations from non-inbred diploids were used. Bulks were composed based on both pollen tube growth and berry set upon selfing. After DNA sequencing of the parents and bulks we generated k-mer tables. Set algebra and depth filtering was used to identify bulk-specific k-mers. Coupling and repulsion phase k-mers, transmitted from the SC parent, mapped in both populations to the distal end of chromosome 12. Intersection between the k-mers from both populations, in coupling phase with SC, exposed a shared haplotype of approximately 1.5 Mb. Subsequently we screened read archives of potatoes and wild relatives for k-mers specific to this haplotype. The well-known SC clones US-W4 and RH89-039-16, but surprisingly, also S. chacoense clone M6 were positives. Hence, the S. tuberosum source of SC seems identical to Sli. Furthermore, the candidate region drastically reduced to 333 kb. Haplotype specific KASP markers were designed and validated on a panel of diploid clones including another renown SC dihaploid G254. Interestingly, k-mers specific to the SC haplotype were common in tetraploid varieties. Pedigree information suggests that the SC haplotype was introduced into tetraploid varieties via the founder ‘Rough Purple Chili’.

LY6E blocks coronavirus fusion and confers immune control of viral disease,PRJNA609134;,"Zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) are significant threats to global health, as exemplified by the recent emergence of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Host immune responses to CoV are complex and regulated in part through antiviral interferons. However, the interferon-stimulated gene products that inhibit CoV are not well characterized. Here, we show that interferon-inducible lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E) potently restricts cellular infection by multiple CoVs, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Mechanistic studies revealed that LY6E inhibits CoV entry into cells by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, mice lacking Ly6e in hematopoietic cells were highly susceptible to murine CoV infection. Exacerbated viral pathogenesis in Ly6e knockout mice was accompanied by loss of hepatic and splenic immune cells and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways. Accordingly, we found that Ly6e directly protects primary B cells and dendritic cells from murine CoV infection. Our results demonstrate that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis. These findings advance our understanding of immune-mediated control of CoV in vitro and in vivo, knowledge that could help inform strategies to combat infection by emerging CoV.

Discovery of Bat Coronaviruses through Surveillance and Probe Capture-Based Next-Generation Sequencing.,PRJNA606159,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) of bat origin have caused two pandemics in this century. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV both originated from bats, and it is highly likely that bat coronaviruses will cause future outbreaks. Active surveillance is both urgent and essential to predict and mitigate the emergence of these viruses in humans. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is currently the preferred methodology for virus discovery to ensure unbiased sequencing of bat CoVs, considering their high genetic diversity. However, unbiased NGS is an expensive methodology and is prone to missing low-abundance CoV sequences due to the high background level of nonviral sequences present in surveillance field samples. Here, we employ a capture-based NGS approach using baits targeting most of the CoV species. Using this technology, we effectively reduced sequencing costs by increasing the sensitivity of detection. We discovered nine full genomes of bat CoVs in this study and revealed great genetic diversity for eight of them.IMPORTANCE Active surveillance is both urgent and essential to predict and mitigate the emergence of bat-origin CoV in humans and livestock. However, great genetic diversity increases the chance of homologous recombination among CoVs. Performing targeted PCR, a common practice for many surveillance studies, would not reflect this diversity. NGS, on the other hand, is an expensive methodology and is prone to missing low-abundance CoV sequences. Here, we employ a capture-based NGS approach using baits targeting all CoVs. Our work demonstrates that targeted, cost-effective, large-scale, genome-level surveillance of bat CoVs is now highly feasible.Less...",
"A systematic evaluation of the design, orientation, and sequence context dependencies of massively parallel reporter assays",PRJNA598033;,"Enhancers play important roles in evolution and disease. However, traditional assays to test enhancers are low throughput and not scalable to the >100,000 enhancers in the human genome. To better prioritize variants associated with disease and to study the role of enhancers, our group and others developed massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), which functionally screen thousands of sequences for regulatory activity in parallel. Although MPRAs have been applied to address diverse questions in gene regulation, there has been no systematic comparison of how differences in experimental design influence findings, making it difficult to interpret results and compare between groups. Here, we screen a library of 2,440 sequences, representing candidate liver enhancers and controls, in HepG2 cells for regulatory activity using nine different approaches (including conventional episomal, STARR-seq, and lentiviral MPRA designs). We identify subtle but significant differences in the resulting measurements that correlate with epigenetic and sequence-level features. We also test this library in both orientations with respect to the promoter, validating en masse that enhancer activity is robustly independent of orientation. Finally, we develop and apply a novel method to assemble and functionally test libraries of the same putative enhancers as 192-mers, 354-mers, and 678-mers, and observe surprisingly large differences in functional activity. This work provides a framework for the experimental design of high-throughput reporter assays, suggesting that the extended sequence context of tested elements, and to a lesser degree the precise assay, influence MPRA results.
Overall design: We systematically cloned the same library of 2,440 candidate enhancers into nine different MPRA designs. These included episomal vs lentivirally integrated constructs as well as STARR-seq and traditional upstream reporter assays. We also synthesized a subset of the 2,440 candidate sequences as 192bp, 354bp, and 678bp sequences to test for the effect of added sequence context on activity. Finally, we directionally cloned the full library in both directions to compare effects of direction on activity.

Transcriptomic Analysis Of circRNAs/miRNAs/mRNAs upon Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection,PRJNA580021;,"Human circular RNAs can function in competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network by sponging miRNA and regulating gene expression. Viruses are evolved to regulate noncoding RNAs such as miRNAs and circRNAs to facilitate their propagation and pathogenesis. Studies on how host ceRNAs upon human coronavirus infection were scarce, and the functions of circRNAs during the infection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)  has not been deeply revealed. Therefore, we conducted a whole transcriptional profile (RNA-seq) analysis to compare the expression of circRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs between the mock-infected and MERS-CoV-infected human lung adenocarcinoma (Calu-3) cells. Integrated analysis of ceRNAs revealed putative viral pathogenic circRNAs induced by MERS-CoV and their interplay with miRNAs and genes. Our study offered new insights into the mechanisms of interplays of MERS-CoVs and hosts, and established a model promising to be applied to other coronavirus or other viruses for the identification of novel host factors.
Overall design: The expression of cirRNA, miRNA and mRNA were examined in triplicate samples of Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infected (6hpi and 24hpi) and mock infected human lung adenocarcinoma (Calu-3) cells.

Relative timing of type I interferon response and virus replication determines disease outcome during MERS-CoV infection,PRJNA545350;,"Type 1 interferons (IFN-I) generally protect mammalian hosts from virus infections, but in some cases, IFN-I is pathogenic. Because IFN-I is protective, it is commonly used to treat virus infections for which no specific approved drug or vaccine is available. The Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is such an infection, yet little is known about the role of IFN-I in this setting. Here we show that IFN-I signaling is protective during MERS-CoV infection. Blocking IFN-I signaling resulted in delayed virus clearance, enhanced neutrophil infiltration and impaired MERS-CoV-specific T cell responses. Notably, IFN-I administration within 1-day post infection (before virus titers peak) protected mice from lethal infection, despite a decrease in ISG (interferon stimulated gene) and inflammatory cytokine gene expression. In contrast, delayed IFN-I treatment failed to effectively inhibit virus replication, increased infiltration and activation of monocyte-macrophages and neutrophils into the lungs and enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, resulting in fatal pneumonia in an otherwise sub-lethal infection. Together, these results suggest that the relative timing of the IFN-I response and maximal virus replication is key in determining outcomes, at least in infected mice. By extension, IFN-I or combination therapy may need to be used cautiously to treat virus infections in clinical settings.

Liver transcriptome of statin-treated patients,PRJNA542262;,"Background: Clinical data identified an association between the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and incident diabetes in patients with underlying diabetes risk factors such as obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia. The molecular mechanisms however are unknown.
Methods: An observational cross-sectional study included 910 severely obese patients, mean (SD) body mass index 46.7 (8.7), treated with or without statins (ABOS cohort: a biological atlas of severe obesity). Data and sample collection took place in France between 2006 and 2016. Transcriptomic signatures of statin treatment in human liver obtained from genome-wide transcriptomic profiling of five different statin drugs using microarrays were correlated to clinico-biological phenotypes and also assigned to biological pathways and mechanisms.
Results: We determined the hepatic, statin-related gene signature from genome-wide transcriptomic profiling in severely obese patients with varying degrees of glucose tolerance and cardio-metabolic comorbidities. Patients on statin treatment showed higher diabetes prevalence (OR=2.67; 95%CI, 1.60-4.45; P= 0.0002) and impairment of glucose homeostasis. This phenotype was associated with molecular signatures of increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) via activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP1) and concomitant upregulation of the expression of key genes in both fatty acid and triglyceride metabolism.
Conclusions: DNL gene activation profile in response to statins was associated with insulin resistance and the diabetic status of the patients. Identified molecular signatures thus suggest that statin treatment increases the risk for diabetes in humans at least in part via induction of DNL.
Overall design: Total RNA from liver samples of 910 patients was extracted for Affymetrix microarray analysis from 30 mg frozen liver biopsies using Trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by a purification step on RNeasy columns (Qiagen). RNA purity and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA integrity was quantified using the Agilent RNA6000 Nano assay and an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer. Nine hundred and ten samples complying with Affymetrix QC standards and a RNA integrity number (RIN) value of 5 to 7 were randomized for further processing and 300 ng RNA per sample was amplified using the Affymetrix WT amplification kit. Fragmented sscDNA was labelled using the Affymetrix WT Terminal Labeling Kit. Labeled DNA was then hybridized to Human Transcriptome Arrays 2.0 (Affymetrix) for 16 to 18 hours at 45°C and 60 rpm in a rotating hybridization oven (Hybridization Oven 640, Affymetrix). These high-resolution arrays contain >6 million distinct oligonucleotide probes (25-mers) covering coding and non-coding transcripts, enabling the identification and analysis of differential expression at the gene and exon level.

SMERS,PRJEB18740,"Microbial electrochemical remediation systems (MERS) have recently emerged as a green technology for the effective remediation of PH contaminants coupled with simultaneous energy recovery. In our study, we demonstrate the enhanced removal of DRH compounds in different zones of sediment MERS (SMERS) compared to the open circuit and biotic controls (NON MERS). SMERS was established by inserting electrodes in sediments containing two different spiked concentrations of DRH (5000 mg/Kg, 10000 mg/Kg of sediment). Gas chromatography fingerprints analysis revealed that DRH degradation in closed circuits was accelerated compared to the open circuit conditions. DRH degradation was positively correlated with the increased percentage of COD removal under the closed circuit conditions at each zone. The behaviour of SMERS at a higher concentration of DRH (10000 mg/Kg) was also investigated. Further, community profiling studies using Miseq illumina sequencing outlined the microbial community structure at each zone of the SMERS with different DRH concentrations.

Unbiased functional identification and therapeutic targeting of T cell neoantigens in a spontaneous murine squamous cell carcinoma [Single cell],PRJNA515089;,"The comparative resistance of some cancers including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma to checkpoint blockade is speculated to derive from the low frequency of expressed somatic mutations targeted by T cells as neoantigens.

Justifying use of this model to identify NeoAgs, we confirm activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are detectable and essential for vaccine efficacy of SCC VII and polyI:C co-administration.  Whole-exome sequencing tumor versus normal genome identified 39 nonsynonymous missense mutations that were synthesized into 81 representative 20-mers.  NeoAg-specific CD4+ T cell IFN-γ responses were found against mutations of Pik3ca, Ctnnd1, and Otud5 while both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells produced IFN-γ when stimulated by a single Cltc mutation during in vitro recall assays.  Prophylactic immunization with a mixture of all stimulatory peptides or the Cltc NeoAg alone protected hosts from subsequent tumor challenge.  Further, the Cltc NeoAg, eliciting both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, was also therapeutically beneficial in vivo.

Overall design: For identifcation of TCRs from cells responding to NeoAg in vitro, TCR clonality was assessed in IFN-γ-captured CD4+ and CD8+ T cells via analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data.  FASTQ files were first generated using Bcl2fastq (v2.17.0).  Quality control reports that were generated by FastQC (v0.11.2) (14) showed Nextera contamination, therefore cutadapt (v1.13) (15) was run with an adapter mask of 35 to exclude the contaminated regions.  The FASTQ files were then edited by the Seqtk (v1.3) package to increase read quality.  The trimfq function within Seqtk was used with an error rate threshold of 0.01 to trim the ends of each read and increase the data quality.  The trimmed files were analyzed using TraCeR (v0.6.0) (16) and the reference genome GRCm38.  TCR α and β chains detected by TraCeR were completed to full-length sequences by adding corresponding leader peptide sequences retrieved from the international ImMunoGeneTics information system (IMGT).

Overall design: For identificaion of NeoAg variants, which is described herein, sequence reads from Exome-Seq of the tumor and normal tail samples were aligned to the mm10 reference genome using SpeedSeq Align (v0.0.3a). Exome variants were identified using SpeedSeq Somatic (v0.0.3a) and variants were annotated using SNPeff (v4.1).  Reads from RNA-Seq of the tumor were aligned using STAR aligner (v2.4.1c).  In order to confirm the expression of exome variants in the tumor, the aligned RNA data was compared with the reference genome to check the presence of exome variants using Freebayes software (v0.9.16).  Variants were considered for further analysis only if they met following criteria:  sequencing depth at position of variant ≥ 10 in normal exome as well as in tumor exome and transcriptome, variant allele observations in normal exome = 0, variant allele observations in tumor exome ≥ 10, variant allele frequency in tumor RNA ≥ 20%, somatic score from SpeedSeq ≥ 0, SNP quality score ≥ 20, and the variant was protein coding and protein changing.  For single nucleotide variants, two 20-mer peptides containing the mutation at positions 6 and 15 for each variant were generated using an in-house peptide generation pipeline.

Pentatricopeptide repeat factor KPAF4 functions as poly(A) binding protein in mitochondria of trypanosomes,PRJNA477550,"Most mitochondrial messenger RNAs of trypanosomes undergo U-insertion/deletion editing, and 3′-end adenylation and uridylation. In the causative agent of sleeping sickness, Trypanosoma brucei, internal sequence changes and terminal extensions are tightly coordinated: addition of short (A) tail prior to editing stabilizes edited transcript while post-editing A/U-tailing renders mRNA competent for ribosome recruitment. The enzymes contributing adenosines (KPAP1 poly(A) polymerase) and uridines (RET1 TUTase) have been identified, along with polyadenylation factors required for short A-tail (KPAF3) and long A/U-tail (KPAF1-2) addition. Although participation of a poly(A) binding protein (PABP) in coupling of editing and 3′ modification processes has been inferred, the gene encoding a mitochondrial PABP variant appears to be missing from trypanosomal genomes . We report the identification of an essential pentatricopeptide repeat-containing (PPR) Kinetoplast Polyadenylation Factor 4 (KPAF4), which fulfils properties and functions of a poly(A) binding protein. We show that KPAF4 binding to 3′ untranslated region and A-tail stabilizes mRNA by impeding 3¬′-5′ exonucleolytic activity of the mitochondrial processome. Conversely, KPAF4 binding inhibits RET1 TUTase-catalyzed uridylation of A-tailed transcripts and, therefore, premature A/U-tailing of pre-edited and partially-edited mRNAs. This quality check point ensures translational blockade of mRNAs lacking a complete protein coding sequence. Our findings also implicate the RNA editing substrate binding complex (RESC) in mediating a critical interaction between 5′-end bound MERS and 3′-end bound polyadenylation complexes to enable mRNA circularization. This event appears to be critical for transcript stability during the editing process while the post-editing A/U-tailing and translational activation likely require mRNA linearization.Less...",

"The FibroChip, a functional DNA microarray to monitor cellulolysis and hemicellulolysis activities of rumen microbiota",PRJNA420557;,"Ruminants are the most efficient herbivorous animals to transform plant biomass into edible products, principally thanks to the rumen microbiota that produces a large array of enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of plant cell wall polysaccharides. Several biotic and abiotic factors influence the efficiency of fiber degradation, which can ultimately impact the animal productivity and health. To provide more insight on mechanisms involved in the modulation of fibrolytic activity, a functional DNA microarray targeting genes coding for key enzymes involved in cellulose and hemicellulose degradation by rumen microbiota was designed. The DNA microarray, designated FibroChip, was validated using targets of increasing complexity. This new tool demonstrated sensitivity and specificity as well as explorative and semi-quantitative potential.
The FibroChip was designed with the objective to propose a high throughput tool that enables to get a rapid picture of the capacity of rumen microorganisms to degrade cellulose and hemicellulose based on a targeted metatranscriptomics approach. We chose to focus on a few number of genes by targeting main ruminal fibrolytic microorganisms and selected CAZyme families that may have a pivotal role in cellulose and hemicellulose degradation. The microarray targets the coding sequence of catalytic domains from 8 CAZyme families involved in cellulose and hemicellulose degradation (i.e. glycoside hydrolases GH5, GH9, GH10, GH11, GH43 and GH48, and carbohydrate esterases CE1 and CE6). Taken together, these families present complementary activities needed for the complete degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose. In total, 392 nucleic sequences encoding 363 GH and 29 CE were kept for the microarray design. These sequences originated from 41 bacterial species, 4 protozoal species and 10 fungal species. The microarray is composed of 1631 25-mer probes. GoArrays strategy consisting by associating 2 25-mer probes targeting the same gene (Rimour et al., 2005) was also emplyed to determine 2618 composite probes of 54-mers. Triplicate of probes of 25 and 54-mers were synthetized in situ on an Agilent 8x15K DNA microarray. The microarray contained also 382 Agilent internal control probes including positive controls, negative controls and quality control probes. Probes were randomly placed on the array to avoid position bias.
Overall design: The objective of this work was to validate the FibroChip design and evaluate its sensitivity and specificity. For this, targets of increasing complexity were tested: PCR products, then bacterial genomic DNA, RNA from one bacteria, and finally RNA from a cow rumen content (complex microbial community). (1) PCR products were amplified from 7 genes selected to represent the diversity of targeted CAZyme families and microorganisms. Genes were cloned beforehand to ensure that a unique sequence was hybridized. (2)  Genomic DNA from the strain Escherichia coli K12 was used to assess the specificity of probes as no gene from this bacterium was targeted on the FibroChip whearas the gDNA from 3 targeted bacteria strains (Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus albus 20 and Bacteroides xylanisolvens XB1A) were used to assess the sensitivity of the DNA microarray. (3) To test the ability of the FibroChip to detect the differential expression of genes, the microarray was used to analyze the transcriptome of the rumen bacterium Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, cultivated in two media differing by their carbon source, i.e. the simple sugar cellobiose (C) or the complex substrate wheat straw (WS). (4) The FibroChip was then used to analyze the metatranscriptome of a cow rumen content.

Boechera retrofracta,PRJNA417776,"Closely related to the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the genus Boechera is known to contain both sexual and apomictic species or accessions within the species. Boechera retrofracta is a diploid sexually reproducing species and is thought to be an ancestral parent species of the apomictic species Boechera divaricarpa.Findings. Here we report the de novo assembly of the B. retrofracta genome using short Illumina and Roche reads from 1 paired-end and 3 mate pair libraries. The distribution of 23-mers from the paired end library has indicated a low level of heterozygosity and the presence of detectable duplications and triplications. The genome size was estimated to be equal 227 Mb.N50 of the assembled scaffolds was 2.3 Mb. 27048 protein-coding genes were predicted using a hybrid approach that combines homology-based and de novo methods. Also repeats, tRNA and rRNA genes were annotated. Finally, genes of B. retrofracta and 6 other Brassicaceae species were used for phylogenetic tree reconstruction.Conclusions. B. retrofracta is a plant of particular interest as an ancestor of various hybrids including apomictic species. An assembled genome of B. retrofracta will help in the challenging assembly of the highly heterozygous genomes of hybrid apomictic species such as B. divaricarpa, and to decipher the hybridogenesis events that took place in the formation of apomictic Boechera accessions.Less...",

Sense and Antisense Transcription Defines Mitochondrial RNA Boundaries in Trypanosomes,PRJNA402081,"Mitochondrial genomes are often transcribed into polycistronic units wherein protein coding regions are punctuated by tRNAs whose excision defines mRNA boundaries. Although maxicircle DNA of trypanosomes lacks tRNA genes, the monophosphorylated 5′ and uniform 3′ termini of mature mRNAs and rRNAs are indicative of the primary transcript partitioning by an endonuclease. We demonstrate that mRNAs and rRNAs are independently transcribed as extended precursors, and processed by antisense RNA-controlled exonucleolytic trimming that delimits the 3′ end. The transcription start-defined 5′ terminus is converted into the monophosphorylated state by the MERS1 pyrophosphohydrolase complex, which also includes a pentatricopeptide repeat subunit. MERS complex acting as “protein cap” stabilizes mRNAs and rRNAs, but not gRNAs retaining 5′ triphosphate. We identify the RNA editing substrate binding complex as the coupling interface between 5′ modification, 3′ processing, and internal mRNA editing. We conclude that mitochondrial genes are transcribed as individual units irrespective of their genomic location.Less...",

Mus musculus,PRJNA349036;,"In human and mouse stem cells and brain, 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) can occur outside of CG dinucleotides.  Using protein binding microarrays (PBMs) containing 60-mer DNA probes, we evaluated the effect of 5mC and 5hmC on one DNA strand on the double-stranded DNA binding of the mouse B-ZIP transcription factors (TFs) CREB1, ATF1, and JUND.  5mC inhibited CREB1 binding to the canonical CRE half-site |GTCA, but increased binding to the C/EBP half-site |GCAA.  5hmC inhibited CREB1 binding to all 8-mers except TGAT|GCAA, where binding is enhanced.  We observed similar DNA binding patterns with the closely related TF: ATF1.  In contrast, both 5mC and 5hmC inhibited binding of JUND.  These results identify new DNA sequences that are well-bound by CREB1 and ATF1 only when they contain 5mC or 5hmC.  Analysis of two x-ray structures examines the consequences of 5mC and 5hmC on DNA binding by CREB and FOS|JUN.

Direct and tissue-specific assessment of the damaging potential of regulatory SNPs,PRJNA341669;,"In the era of GWAS and personalized medicine systematically deciphering the impact of non-coding sequence variation on the regulatory genome is a critical bottleneck. Here we present Sasquatch a novel computational approach to estimate and visualize the effects of noncoding-variants on transcription factor (TF) binding using DNase I footprint data. Developed to provide an unbiased approach to prioritise non-coding variants for functional analysis, Sasquatch performs exhaustive, k-mer based analysis of average footprints to determine any k-mers potential for TF binding and quantifies how this is changed by sequence variants.  Importantly the approach only requires one DNase-seq dataset per cell-type, from any genotype and is resilient across differing experimental procedures and sequence depths.

Drosophila melanogaster,PRJNA326755;,"Small regulatory RNAs guide Argonaute (Ago) proteins in a sequence-specific manner to their targets and therefore have important roles in eukaryotic gene silencing. Of the three small RNA classes, microRNAs and short interfering RNAs are processed from double-stranded precursors into defined 21- to 23-mers by Dicer, an endoribonuclease with intrinsic ruler function. PIWI- interacting RNAs (piRNAs)—the 22–30-nt-long guides for PIWI- clade Ago proteins that silence transposons in animal gonads— are generated independently of Dicer from single-stranded precursors. piRNA 5′ ends are defined either by Zucchini, the Drosophila homologue of mitoPLD—a mitochondria-anchored endonuclease, or by piRNA-guided target cleavage. Formation of piRNA 3′ ends is poorly understood. Here we report that two genetically and mechanistically distinct pathways generate piRNA 3′ ends in Drosophila. The initiating nucleases are either Zucchini or the PIWI-clade proteins Aubergine (Aub)/Ago3. While Zucchini- mediated cleavages directly define mature piRNA 3′ ends, Aub/ Ago3-mediated cleavages liberate pre-piRNAs that require extensive resection by the 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease Nibbler (Drosophila homologue of Mut-7). The relative activity of these two pathways dictates the extent to which piRNAs are directed to cytoplasmic or nuclear PIWI-clade proteins and thereby sets the balance between post-transcriptional and transcriptional silencing. Notably, loss of both Zucchini and Nibbler reveals a minimal, Argonaute-driven small RNA biogenesis pathway in which piRNA 5′ and 3′ ends are directly produced by closely spaced Aub/Ago3-mediated cleavage events. Our data reveal a coherent model for piRNA biogenesis, and should aid the mechanistic dissection of the processes that govern piRNA 3′-end formation.

SMAvirusChip was evaluated with 20 laboratory reference-strain viruses. These viruses could be specifically detected when alone in a sample or when artificially mixed within a single sample. The sensitivity of SMAvirusChip was evaluated using 10-fold serial dilutions of dengue virus (DENV). The results showed a detection limit as low as 2.6E3 RNA copies/mL. Additionally, the sensitivity was one log10 lower (2.6E2 RNA copies/mL) than quantitative real-time RT-PCR and sufficient to detect viral genomes in clinical samples.

SELMAP - SELEX Affinity Landscape Mapping of transcription factor binding sites using integrated microfluidics,PRJEB9897,"Transcription factors (TFs) alter gene expression in response to changes in the environment through sequence-specific interactions with the DNA. These interactions are best portrayed as a landscape of TF binding affinities. Current methods to study sequence-specific binding preferences suffer from limited dynamic range, sequence bias, lack of specificity and limited throughput. We have developed a microfluidic-based device for SELEX Affinity Landscape MAPping (SELMAP) of TF binding, which allows high-throughput measurement of 16 proteins in parallel. We used it to measure the relative affinities of Pho4, AtERF2 and Btd proteins to millions of different DNA binding sites, and detected both high and low-affinity interactions in equilibrium conditions, generating a comprehensive landscape of the relative TF affinities to all possible DNA 6-mers, and even DNA10-mers with increased sequencing depth. Low quantities of both the TFs and DNA oligomers were sufficient for obtaining high-quality results, significantly reducing experimental costs. SELMAP allows in-depth screening of hundreds of TFs, and provides a means for better understanding of the regulatory processes that govern gene expression.Less...",

ARK: Aggregate of Reads by K-Means for Estimation of Bacterial Community Composition,PRJEB9828,"There has been a recent surge of interest in using compressed sensing inspired and convex-optimization based methods to solve the estimation problem for bacterial community composition. These methods typically rely on summarizing the sequence data by frequencies of low-order k-mers and matching this information statistically with a taxonomically structured database. Here we show that the accuracy of the resulting community composition estimates can be substantially improved by aggregating the reads from a sample with an unsupervised machine learning approach prior to the estimation phase. The aggregation of reads is a pre-processing approach where we use a standard K-means clustering algorithm that partitions a large set of reads into subsets with reasonable computational cost to provide several vectors of first order statistics instead of only single statistical summarization in terms of k-mer frequencies. The output of the clustering is then processed further to obtain the final estimate for each sample. The resulting method is called Aggregation of Reads by K-means (ARK), and it is based on a statistical argument via mixture density formulation. ARK is found to improve the fidelity and robustness of several recently introduced methods, with only a modest increase in computational complexity.

Quality control of microbiota metagenomics by k-mer analysis with SOLiD sequencing technology,PRJEB7925,"The biological and clinical consequences of the tight interactions between host and microbiota are rapidly being unravelled by next generation sequencing technologies and sophisticated bioinformatics, also referred to as microbiota metagenomics. The recent success of metagenomics has created a demand to rapidly apply the technology to large case-control cohort studies and to studies of microbiota from various habitats, including habitats relatively poor in microbes. It is therefore of foremost importance to enable a robust and rapid quality assessment of metagenomic data from samples that challenge present technological limits (sample numbers and size). Here we demonstrate that the distribution of overlapping k-mers of metagenome sequence data predicts sequence quality as defined by gene distribution and efficiency of sequence mapping to a reference gene catalogue. We used serial dilutions of gut microbiota metagenomic datasets to generate well defined high to low quality metagenomes. We also analysed a collection of 52 microbiota derived metagenomes. We demonstrate that k-mer distributions of metagenomic sequence data identify sequence contaminations, such as sequences derived from “empty” ligation products. Of note, k-mer distributions were also able to predict the frequency of sequences mapping to a reference gene catalogue not only for the well-defined serial dilution datasets, but also for 52 human gut microbiota derived metagenomic datasets. We propose that k-mer analysis of raw metagenome sequence reads should be implemented as a first quality assessment prior to more extensive bioinformatical analysis, such as sequence filtering and gene mapping. With the rising demand for metagenomic analysis of microbiota it is crucial to provide tools for rapid and efficient decision making. This will eventually lead to a faster turn-around time, improved analytical quality including sample quality metrics and a significant cost reduction. Finally, improved quality assessment will have a major impact on the robustness of biological and clinical conclusions drawn from metagenomic studies.Less...",
Solution hybrid selection capture for the recovery of functional full-length eukaryotic cDNAs from complex environmental samples,PRJEB6672,"Species-rich eukaryotic microbial communities play key functional roles in soil biology and also potentially represent a rich source of natural products including biocatalysts. Culture-independent molecular methods are powerful tools to isolate and characterise functional genes from uncultured microorganisms. However, none of the methods used in environmental genomics allow for a rapid isolation of numerous functional genes from eukaryotic microbial communities. In this study, we developed an original adaptation of the solution hybrid selection (SHS) for an efficient recovery of functional cDNAs synthesized from soil-extracted polyadenylated mRNA. This protocol was implemented on the Glycoside Hydrolase 11 gene family encoding endoxylanases for which we designed 35 explorative 31-mers capture probes. SHS was implemented on four soil eukaryotic cDNA pools. After two successive rounds of capture, more than 90% of the resulting cDNAs were GH11 sequences, of which about 70% were full-length. Several of them were successfully expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Sequencing of PCR-amplified GH11 gene fragments showed that capture selected hundreds of phylogenetically diverse sequences, all of them different from those deposited in databases. This protocol offers the possibility of performing exhaustive exploration of eukaryotic gene families represented by numerous alleles within eukaryotic microbial communities thriving in any type of environment.Less...",

Homo sapiens,PRJNA262677;,"Until now, it has been reasonably assumed that specific base-pair recognition is the only mechanism controlling the specificity of transcription factor (TF)−DNA binding. Contrary to this assumption, here we show that nonspecific DNA sequences possessing certain repeat symmetries, when present outside of specific TF binding sites (TFBSs), statistically control TF−DNA binding preferences. We used high-throughput protein−DNA binding assays to measure the binding levels and free energies of binding for several human TFs to tens of thousands of short DNA sequences with varying re- peat symmetries. Based on statistical mechanics modeling, we iden- tify a new protein−DNA binding mechanism induced by DNA se- quence symmetry in the absence of specific base-pair recognition, and experimentally demonstrate that this mechanism indeed gov- erns protein−DNA binding preferences.

Briefly, we represent three categories of 36-bp sequences: 1) 28800 probes centered at a GTCACGTGAC site and flanked by repetitive elements (probe names starting with Ariel_); 2) Unbound probes (or negative controls); and 3) Bound probes, which correspond to randomly selected genomic regions bound in vivo by c-Myc, Max, or Mad2 (ChIP-seq P < 10^(-10) in HeLaS3 or K562 celld (ENCODE)), which contain at least two consecutive 8-mers with universal PBM E-score > 0.4 (Munteanu and Gordan, LNCS 2013).

Homo sapiens,PRJNA262558;,"The E2F family of transcription factors is typically described as binding the family consensus sequence TTTSSCGC, were S is G or C. Analysis of ChIP-seq experiments, however, reveals that this consensus sequence is found in only 10% of ChIP-seq peaks, suggesting that the mechanism for E2F sequence recognition cannot be explained using previous assumptions.  In order to better understand E2F sequence specificity, we performed high-throughput Universal Protein Binding Microarray experiments to obtain the relative binding affinity for every possible 8-mer, as well a large number of bound and unbound probes intheir native genomic sequence context. Our results show that while the consensus sequence is bound with relatively high affinity, numerous other 8-mers, many distinctly different from the consensus motif, are bound with similar or greater affinity.  These data suggest that the mechanism for E2F sequence specificity is likely complex, and cannot readily be explained through a simple consensus sequence. Because of this, complex regression models were created using the bound and unbound probe binding affinities, and were able to predict binding in vivo, where the consensus sequence and varoius E2F PWMs were not.

Homo sapiens,PRJNA252907;,"The Myc-Max heterodimer is a DNA binding protein that regulates expression of a large number of genes. Genome occupancy of Myc-Max is thought to be driven by E-boxes (CACGTG or variants) to which the heterodimer binds in vitro. By analyzing ChIP-Seq datasets, we demonstrated that the positions occupied by Myc-Max across the human genome correlate with the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription machinery better than with E-boxes. Metagene analyses showed that in promoter regions, Myc was uniformly positioned about 100 bp upstream of essentially all promoter proximal paused polymerases with Max about 10 bp upstream of Myc. We re-evaluated the DNA binding properties of full length Myc-Max proteins using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and protein-binding microarrays (PBM). EMSA results demonstrated Myc-Max heterodimers have high affinity for both E-box containing and non-specific DNA. Quantification of the relative affinities of Myc-Max for all possible 8- mers using PBM assays showed that sequences surrounding core 6-mers significantly affect binding. Comparing to the in vitro sequence preferences, Myc-Max genomic occupancy measured by ChIP-Seq was largely, although not completely, independent of sequence specificity. Our results suggest that the transcription machinery and associated promoter accessibility play an important role in genomic occupancy of Myc.

Homo sapiens,PRJNA244298;,"Background: The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus in the Middle East (designated MERS-CoV) is a reminder of the zoonotic potential of coronaviruses and the severe disease these etiologic agents can cause in humans. Clinical features of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) include severe acute pneumonia and renal failure that is highly reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV. The host response is a key component of highly pathogenic respiratory virus infection. Here, we computationally analyzed gene expression changes in a human airway epithelial cell line infected with two genetically distinct MERS-CoV strains obtained from human patients, MERS-CoV-EMC (designated EMC) and MERS-CoV-London (designated LoCoV).   Results: Using topological techniques, such as persistence homology and filtered clustering, we characterized the host response system to the different MERS-CoVs, with LoCoV inducing early kinetic changes, between 3 and 12 hours post infection, compared to EMC. Robust transcriptional changes distinguished the two MERS-CoV strains predominantly at the late time points. Combining statistical analysis of infection and cytokine-stimulated treatment transcriptomics, we identified differential innate and pro-inflammatory responses between the two virus strains, including up-regulation of extracellular remodeling genes following LoCoV infection and differential pro-inflammatory responses between the two strains.   Conclusions: These transcriptional differences may be the result of amino acid differences in viral proteins known to modulate innate immunity against MERS infection.

While a rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV that results in mild-to-moderate disease has been utilized to describe the pathogenesis of this virus and for the evaluation of therapeutics, the inability to produce uniform disease with substantial virus replication complicates analysis in countermeasure studies. In an attempt to identify a more robust disease model, DPP4 sequences of various non-human primates were aligned. Modeling of the interactions between the receptor binding domain of MERS-CoV and its cognate receptor DPP4 predicted a ""good fit"" with complete conservation of all of the critical residues. To determine the feasibility of the marmoset as a MERS-CoV disease model, common marmosets were inoculated with MERS-CoV via combined intratracheal, intranasal, oral and ocular routes.

Here we introduce NIKS (“Needle in the k-stack”), a reference-free algorithm based on comparing k-mers in whole-genome sequencing data for precise discovery of homozygous mutations. We applied NIKS to eight mutants induced in non-reference rice cultivars and to two mutants of the non-model species Arabis alpina. In both species, comparing pooled F2 individuals selected for mutant phenotypes revealed small sets of mutations including the causal changes.

Homo sapiens,PRJNA154619;,"Alternative splicing (AS) is a key process underlying the expansion of proteomic diversity and the regulation of gene expression. However, the contribution of AS to the control of embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency is not well understood. Here, we identify an evolutionarily conserved ESC-specific AS event that changes the DNA binding preference of the forkhead family transcription factor FOXP1. We show that the ESC-specific isoform of FOXP1 stimulates the expression of transcription factor genes required for pluripotency including OCT4, NANOG, NR5A2 and GDF3, while concomitantly repressing genes required for ESC differentiation. Remarkably, this isoform also promotes the maintenance of ESC pluripotency and the efficient reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells. These results thus reveal that an AS switch plays a pivotal role in the regulation of pluripotency and functions by controlling critical ESC-specific transcriptional programs.

Using an antibody capable of efficiently immunoprecipitating both isoforms, >3400 significant ChIP-Seq peaks were detected across the human genome. To assess if these peaks are sites of FOXP1 and FOXP1-ES occupancy, we determined whether they are significantly enriched in individual PBM-derived 8-mers that bind to either or both isoforms.Less...",GSE31006
Modeling Formamide Denaturation of Probe-Target Hybrids for Improved Microarray Probe Design in Microbial Diagnostics,PRJNA148019;,"This study aimed to model formamide-based melting for the optimization of the sensitivity and specifcity of oligonucleotide probes in dignostic high-density microarrays.
Formamide melting profiles of DNA oligonucleotides were obtained with a high-density microarray targeting 16S rRNA genes of Escherichia coli and Rhodobacter sphaeroides.  One or two mismatched versions of perfect match probes were included on the array to systematically analyze the effect of formamide on mismatch stability and mismatch discrimination.
A thermodynamics-based mathematical model of formamide denaturation was developed to predict the formamide melting profiles with sufficient accuracy to help with oligonucleotide design in microbial ecology applications.
Overall design: 16S rRNA sequences with GenBank accession codes U00006 ( E. coli ) and X53853 (R. sphaeroides) were used for probe design.  The following oligonucleotide probe sets were used for the systematic analysis of the effect of formamide on probe-target hybrids (parenthetic information gives set name followed by the number of probes): 22-mer perfect match probes tiling the 16S rRNA gene of E. coli (TileE, n=1521), perfect match E.coli probes of variable length between 18 and 26 mers (Length, n=1045), E. coli probes with central single mismatches (OneM, n=1563), E. coli probes with single positional mismatches (PosM, n=4092), E. coli probes with single deletion mismatches (Gap, n=248), E. coli probes with single insertion mismatches (Insertion, n=248), E. coli probes with two separate mismatches (TwoM, n=1674), E. coli probes with central tandem mismatches (Tandem, n=558), and 22-mer perfect match probes tiling the 16S rRNA gene of R. sphaeroides.

Homo sapiens,PRJNA125253;,"The SKOV-3 and Caov-3 ovarian cancer cell lines where seeded onto the 100mm cell culture plate for overnight.  The cells were then incubated with IL-6 (30ng/ml) alone for one hour or pre-treated with siltuximab for four hours and then treated with IL-6 for one hour. Total RNA was collected from these cells using TRIzol® Reagent (GIBCO Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To account for and eliminate biologic noise, RNA was isolated from three distinct flasks of each cell line and pooled together. RNA quality was determined via ethidium bromide staining following agarose/formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. Total RNA was processed and hybridized to Affymetrix Genechip HG-U95Av2 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) by the Gene Array Technology Center at Harvard Medical School (http://genome.med.harvard.edu).

Podospora anserina,PRJNA124969;,"A genome wide microarray, covering the 10546 presently known and predicted CDS, has been constructed with the Agilent in-situ synthesized 60-mers technology.
1) A library of 10 oligonucleotides per CDS has been design by the manufacturer.
2) A computational step has been performed to determine 3' position, intron position and cross-hybridization rate of all probes. These data have been compiled to attribute a score to each probe and thus, to select a first set of 4 oligonucleotides per CDS.
3) Microarray v.2 (GPL10115), manufactured with this design, have been used for a selection procedure based on the use of transcriptomic experimental data generated with diverse culture conditions. To maximize the number of expressed CDS, experimental data were generated with a large range of growth conditions covering crucial physiological changes from key steps of vegetative growth and sexual development.For each condition, four biological replicates were done to increase the statistical power of the analysis. An oligonucleotide scoring has been settled to select the best oligonucleotide per CDS.
The final array design, Microarray v.3 (GPL10116), contained 10,539 probes for nuclear CDS. The array was enriched with 17 mitochondrial CDS probes that did not undergo the experimental screening. Each probe was replicated four times on each 44K array to improve the statistical significance of results.

Overall design: We developed oligonucleotide microarrays for the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina as part of the ANR program project grant ANR-05-BLAN-0385 (project SexDevMycol), coordinated by R. Debuchy. This project was aimed to analyze the sexual development of /P. anserina/ with a variety of approaches, including transcriptomic profiling. Different versions of microarrays were tested on mycelium and sexual development time courses, to evaluate their perfomance in comparing transcriptomic profiles of vegetative vs sexual stages, and in analyzing transcriptomic profiles evolution during sexual development. Complete analyses were performed with the microarray final version (v.III) and several manuscripts dealing with these topics are in preparation.
The s (small s) and S (big S) strains of Podospora anserina are different geographical isolates of the same species. Both strains can cross and have identical ITS (accession #: AY278557 and GU391422) confirming that they belong to the same species. The S strain has been completely sequenced (Espagne et al., Genome Biology, 2008, 9, R77 ) and its genome is currently at the finishing step (P. Silar and P. Wincker, unpublished results). The genome of the s strain is not sequenced, and only a few genes are known.

Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1,PRJNA123749;,"Legionella pneumophila is a gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen that infects and multiplies in a broad range of phagocytic protozoan and mammalian phagocytes. Based on the observation that small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) play an important role in controlling virulence-related genes in several pathogenic bacteria, we attempted to test the hypothesis that sRNAs play a similar role in L. pneumophila. We used computational prediction followed by experimental verification to identify and characterize sRNAs encoded in the L. pneumophila genome.   A 50-mer probe microarray was constructed to test the expression of predicted sRNAs in bacteria grown under a variety of conditions. This strategy successfully identified 22 expressed RNAs, out of which six were confirmed by northern blot and RACE. One of the identified sRNAs is highly expressed when the bacteria enter post exponential phase and computational prediction of its secondary structure reveals a striking similarity to the structure of 6S RNA, a widely distributed prokaryotic sRNA, known to regulate the activity of σ70-containing RNAP. A 70-mer probe microarray was used to identify genes affected by L. pneumophila 6S RNA in stationary phase. The 6S RNA encoded by the ssrS gene positively regulates expression of genes encoding type IVB secretion system effectors, stress response genes such as groES and recA as well as many genes with unknown or hypothetical functions. Deletion of 6S RNA significantly reduced L. pneumophila intracellular multiplication in both protist and mammalian host cells, but had no detectable effect on growth in rich media.
Overall design: A microarray was designed for the detection of 101 predicted sRNAs by using OligiWiz version 2.1.3 (Nielsen et al., 2003, Wernersson & Nielsen, 2005). The prokaryotic setting was used to design 50-mers probes located, when possible, at the 3’ end of the predicted genes. Probes for 10 negative controls, representing 10 genes of the L. pneumophila Paris plasmid, were also designed. Probes (Illumina) were dissolved in 50% DMSO to a final concentration of 30 uM and printed in triplicate on UltraGAPS coated glass slides (Corning) using a PerkinElmer SpotArray microarray printer. Fifteen micrograms of total RNA was labelled during cDNA synthesis using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and amino-allyl dUTP (Sigma). Bacterial genomic DNA was used as the reference channel on each slide to allow comparison of each time point and different samples (Talaat et al., 2002). Five micrograms of genomic DNA (gDNA) was labelled with amino-allyl dUTP by using Klenow fragment and random primers (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 18 h. DNA was subsequently coupled to the succinimidyl ester fluorescent dye AlexaFluor 546 (for cDNA) or Alexa Fluor 647 (for gDNA) (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s protocols. Hybridization and data acquisition were performed as previously described (Hovel-Miner et al., 2009).Very low density array, like the sRNA microarray used here, cannot be normalised with common procedure like total intensity or lowess. Local background was removed from spot signal intensity and the noise signal was estimated by recording the average signal intensity of 10 negative controls printed on the chip. Normalisation of signal intensity was carried out by calculating the fold increase over the noise signal value. Correlation of replicates using this normalisation procedure was ≥ 0.95.Less...",GSE19196
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,PRJNA119945;,"The Chlamydomonas reinhardtii transcriptome was characterized from nutrient-replete and sulfur-depleted wild-type and snrk2.1 mutant cells; the mutant is null for the regulatory serine-threonine kinase SNRK2.1, which is required for acclimation to sulfur deprivation. The transcriptome analyses involved microarray hybridization and RNA-seq technology; RT-qPCR evaluation of the data obtained by these techniques showed that RNA-seq is significantly more quantitative than microarray hybridizations. Sulfur-deprivation-responsive transcripts included those encoding proteins involved in sulfur acquisition and assimilation, recycling of sulfur-containing amino acids, synthesis of reduced sulfur metabolites and cofactors, and modification of cellular structures such as the cell wall and complexes associated with the photosynthetic apparatus. Moreover, the data suggest that cells deprived of sulfur favors accumulation of proteins with fewer sulfur-containing amino acids. Most of these sulfur-deprivation responses are controlled by the SNRK2.1 kinase. Furthermore, the snrk2.1 mutant exhibits a set of unique responses during both sulfur-replete and sulfur-depleted conditions that are not observed in wild-type cells. Many of these responses are likely to be elicited by singlet O2 accumulation in the mutant cells. The transcriptome results for the wild-type and mutant cells strongly suggest the occurrence of massive changes in cellular physiology and metabolism as the cells become depleted for sulfur, and reveal aspects of acclimation that are likely critical for cell survival.

Overall design: Chlamydomonas strains used for this study were D66 (wt strain; nit2 cw15 mt+), ars11 (snrk2.1cw15mt+), 21gr (wt strain; nit5 mt-) and sac1 (sac1mt+). The ars11 strain was designated as the snrk2.1 mutant throughout since the lesion is in the SNRK2.1 gene. Cells were cultured under continuous light of ~60 μmol photon m-2s-1 at 23ºC in liquid and on solid Tris-Acetate-Phosphate (TAP) medium. To impose S deprivation, cells in mid-logarithmic growth phase were washed twice with liquid TAP medium without S (TAP-S), and equal numbers of cells were resuspended in TAP or TAP-S. Cell aliquots were collected for RNA isolation just prior to and 6 h after being transferred to TAP and TAP-S medium.
Total RNA from wt (D66) and snrk2.1 mutant cells after 0 and 6 h of being transferred to -S medium were submitted to Illumina for sequencing using their proprietary Genome Analyzer. cDNA libraries were assembled according to the manufacturer’s RNA-seq protocol, loaded and sequenced as 35-mers in a total of 11 Solexa lanes.

Escherichia coli,PRJNA119781;,"The existence of two separate lineages of Escherichia coli O157:H7 has previously been reported, and research indicates that  one of these lineages (lineage I) might be more pathogenic towards human hosts. We have previously shown that the more pathogenic lineage expresses higher levels of Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2) than the non-pathogenic lineage II.  To evaluate why lineage 2 isolates do not express appreciable levels of toxin, two lineage 2 isolates (FRIK966 and FRIK2000) were chosen as representatives of lineage 2 and whole genome microarrays were performed using Agilent microarrays using the E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 lineage I clinical type isolate as a reference.  Microarray results were utilized to evaluate what genes and pathways might be missing or differentially expressed.  Quantitative RT-PCR was utilized to validate the microarray data.
Overall design: Based upon the transcriptome of Escherichia coli O157:H7 EDL933 an oligonucleotide microarray, made up of 60 mers was designed.  A total of 4873 genes in an 8 x 15K Agilent microarray design.  Designed using a custom script, specifications for gene specific oligos were based upon various design characteristics such as temperature of melting, 3’ location, specificity, lack of repeat nucleotides, etc. (Charbonnier et al., 2005).

Protein translation as major target for gene expression control of O. tsutsugamushi,PRJNA117253;,"Orientia tsutsugamushi, an obligate intracellular bacterium, is the causative agent of Scrub typhus. The bacterium can replicate both in its arthropod host and in mammals, including humans. The control mechanisms for bacterial gene expression within eukaryotic host cells are largely unknown. Previously, we reported that the O. tsutsugamushi genome has the highest repeat density of any sequenced bacterial genome due to the extraordinary proliferation of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), suggesting a unique genomic evolution in intracellular niches. In this study, the global gene expression of O. tsutsugamushi within eukaryotic cells was examined using a microarray and proteomic approaches. These approaches identified 643 genes, corresponding to approximately 30% of genes encoded in the genome. The majority of expressed genes belonged to several functional categories including protein translation, protein processing/secretion, and replication/repair. We also searched the conserved sequence blocks (CSBs) in the genomes of different O. tsutsugamushi strains to identify gene blocks impermeable to proliferating MGEs. Although extensive shuffling of genomic sequences was observed between two different strains, 204 CSBs with sizes ranging from 1 kbp to 29 kbp, covering 48% of the genome, were identified. When combining the data of the CSBs and global gene expression, CSBs in the O. tsutsugamushi genomes correlates well with the location of expressed genes, especially in protein level, suggesting the functional conservation between gene expression and genomic location. Finally, we compared global gene expression of the bacteria infecting fibroblasts and macrophages using microarray analysis. Major changes in the expression of genes with known functions were the downregulation of genes involved in translation, protein processing and secretion, which resulted in significant reduction in bacterial translation rates and growth within macrophages. These results suggest that the replication of O. tsutsgamushi is controlled primarily by the expression of genes involved in bacterial translation and subsequent protein processing/secretion.
Overall design: Microarray analysis using the Combimatrix CustomArrayTM 4X2 microarray (CombiMatrix) was performed according to the standard CombiMatrix protocol described in detail at http://www.combimatrix.com/ products_custom4x2.htm (PTL005).

Bos taurus,PRJNA117095;,"Our objectives were to compare gene expression profiles in neutrophils (PMN) during a Streptococcus uberis mastitis challenge between lactating cows subjected to feed restriction to induce negative energy balance (NEB; n = 5) and cows fed ad libitum to maintain positive energy balance (PEB; n = 5).  The NEB cows were feed-restricted to 60% of calculated net energy for lactation requirements for 7 d, whereas PEB cows were fed the same diet for ad libitum intake.  After 5 d of feed restriction, one rear mammary quarter of each cow was inoculated with 5,000 cfu of Streptococcus uberis (strain O140J).  Blood PMN were isolated at 24 h post-inoculation from all cows for RNA extraction and microarray analysis.  NEB resulted in 94 differentially expressed genes compared with PEB.  Of these, 51 genes were down-regulated, including genes involved with antigen presentation (HLADRA and HLAA), respiratory burst (SOD1), and the pro-inflammatory response (TNFA and IRAK-1).  The most affected genes up-regulated by NEB (n = 43) included IL1R2 and IL6, toll-like receptors (TLR2 and TLR4), and THY1. Network analysis by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ® revealed that TNFA was associated with the expression of numerous differentially expressed genes involved with immune response in NEB cows compared with PEB cows.  Energy balance alters PMN expression of several genes involved with immune response, which provides new information on transcriptomic mechanisms associated with post-partal NEB and immune response during early lactation.

We tested RNAcompete by analyzing nine diverse RBPs (HuR, Vts1, FUSIP1, PTB, U1A, SF2/ASF, SLM2, RBM4, and YB1). RNAcompete identified both expected and previously unknown RNA binding preferences. Using in vitro and in vivo binding data, we demonstrate that preferences for individual 7-mers identified by RNAcompete are a more accurate representation of binding activity than conventional motif models.

Experimental analysis of oligonucleotide microarray design criteria to detect deletions by CGH,PRJNA113441;,"BACKGROUND:
Microarray comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is currently one of the most powerful techniques to measure DNA copy number in large genomes. In humans, microarray CGH is widely used to assess copy number variants in healthy individuals and copy number aberrations associated with various diseases, syndromes and disease susceptibility. In model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) the technique has been applied to detect mutations, primarily deletions, in strains of interest. Although various constraints on oligonucleotide properties have been suggested to minimize non-specific hybridization and improve the data quality, there have been few experimental validations for CGH experiments. For genomic regions where strict design filters would limit the coverage it would also be useful to quantify the expected loss in data quality associated with relaxed design criteria.
RESULTS:
We have quantified the effects of filtering various oligonucleotide properties by measuring the resolving power for detecting deletions in the human and C. elegans genomes using NimbleGen microarrays. Approximately twice as many oligonucleotides are typically required to be affected by a deletion in human DNA samples in order to achieve the same statistical confidence as one would observe for a deletion in C. elegans. Surprisingly, the ability to detect deletions strongly depends on the oligonucleotide 15-mer count, which is defined as the sum of the genomic frequency of all the constituent 15-mers within the oligonucleotide. A similarity level above 80% to non-target sequences over the length of the probe produces significant cross-hybridization. We recommend the use of a fairly large melting temperature window of up to 10 C, the elimination of repeat sequences, the elimination of homopolymers longer than 5 nucleotides, and a threshold of -1 kcal/mol on the oligonucleotide self-folding energy. We observed very little difference in data quality when varying the oligonucleotide length between 50 and 70, and even when using an isothermal design strategy.
CONCLUSIONS:
We have determined experimentally the effects of varying several key oligonucleotide microarray design criteria for detection of deletions in C. elegans and humans with NimbleGen's CGH technology. Our oligonucleotide design recommendations should be applicable for CGH analysis in most species.
Overall design: One-copy deletions were studied in both the C. elegans (2 samples) and human (1 sample) genomes. There were no replicate or dye-swap hybridizations.Less...",GSE12208
Transcriptional profiling of cattle infected with Trypanosoma congolense using bovine long oligo (BLO) microarray,PRJNA111785;,"Background: African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) caused by tsetse fly-transmitted protozoa of the genus Trypanosoma is a major constraint on livestock and agricultural production in Africa and is among the top ten global cattle diseases impacting on the poor. Here we show that a functional genomics approach can be used to identify temporal changes in host peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression due to disease progression. We also show that major gene expression differences exist between cattle from trypanotolerant and trypanosusceptible breeds. Using bovine long oligonucleotide microarrays and real time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) validation we analysed PBMC gene expression in naïve trypanotolerant and trypanosusceptible cattle experimentally challenged with Trypanosoma congolense across a 34-day infection time course.
Results: Trypanotolerant N’Dama cattle displayed a rapid and distinct transcriptional response to infection, with a ten-fold higher number of genes differentially expressed at day 14 post infection compared to trypanosusceptible Boran cattle. These analyses identified coordinated temporal gene expression changes for both breeds in responses to trypanosome infection. In addition, a panel of genes were identified that showed pronounced differences in gene expression between the two breeds, which may underlie the phenomena of trypanotolerance and trypanosusceptibility. Gene ontology (GO) analysis demonstrate that the products of these genes may contribute to increased mitochondrial mRNA translational efficiency, a more pronounced B cell response, an elevated activation status and a heightened response to stress in trypanotolerant cattle.
Conclusions: This study has revealed an extensive and diverse range of cellular processes that are altered temporally in response to trypanosome infection in African cattle. Results indicate that the trypanotolerant N’Dama cattle respond more rapidly and with a greater magnitude to infection compared to the trypanosusceptible Boran cattle.  Specifically, a subset of the genes analyzed by qRT-PCR, which display significant breed differences, could collectively contribute to the trypanotolerance trait in N’Dama.
Overall design: Animals and experimental infection

The work presented here is based on an experimental infection that was previously described. Briefly, eight Boran (B. indicus, trypanosusceptible) and eight N’Dama (B. taurus, trypanotolerant) female cattle, aged between 19-28 months, were raised together at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) farm at Kapiti Plains Estate, Kenya in an area free from trypanosomiasis. The cattle were each experimentally infected with the T. congolense clone IL1180, which was delivered via the bites of eight infected tsetse flies [Ref. G. morsitans morsitans]

Blood collection, PBMC isolation and RNA extraction and purification

Peripheral blood (200 ml) was collected before infection and at 14, 21, 25, 29 and 34 dpi in heparanized syringes. These time points were chosen to coincide with the first wave of parasitaemia. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated using Percoll™ gradients (GE Healthcare, http://www.gehealthcare.com) and previously described methods, washed with sterile PBS and stored immediately at -80°C in Tri-reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc, http://www.mrcgene.com). Total RNA was extracted with chloroform and precipitated with isopropanol. Each sample was further DNase-treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega Corp., http://www.promega.com) and purified using the RNeasy® mini kit (Qiagen, http://www.qiagen.com). RNA quality and quantity was subsequently assessed using the 18S/28S ratio and RNA integrity number (RIN) on an Agilent Bioanalyzer with the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip® kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., http://www.agilent.com).

cDNA conversion, labelling and hybridization to bovine long oligonucleotide microarrays

Labelled cDNA was generated using the SuperScript™ Plus Direct cDNA labelling System (Invitrogen Corp., http://www.invitrogen.com) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Briefly, 8 µg of sample RNA was labelled with Alexa Fluor® 555 and 10 µg of common reference RNA (CRR) was labelled with Alexa Fluor® 647. A common reference RNA pool was generated by combing equal quantities of all samples in the study, which included RNA from pre- and post-infection time points. Labelled samples were purified using the purification module included with the SuperScript™ Plus Direct cDNA labelling System, combined and supplemented with approximately 60-70 µl SlideHyb Glass Hybridization Buffer #3 (Ambion Inc., http://www.ambion.com) to a final probe volume of 100 µl.
Probes were hybridized to bovine long oligonucleotide (BLO) microarrays, using an automated HS400 hybridization station (Tecan UK Ltd., http://www.tecan.com) with the following optimized protocol; WASH: 75°C, Runs 1, Wash 10 s, Soak 20 s; PROBE INJECTION: 85°C; Denaturation: 95°C, 2 mins; HYBRIDISATION: 42°C – 4 hrs; 35°C – 4 hrs; 30°C – 4 hrs; agitation frequency medium, WASH: 37°C, Runs 2, Wash 10 s, Soak 20 s; 25°C, Runs 2, Wash 15 s, Soak 30 s; 25°C, Runs 2, Wash 20 s, Soak 40 s and SLIDE DRYING: 25°C for 2 mins.

Data collection, normalization, quality control and statistical analysis

Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix® 4000B scanner (Molecular Devices Corp., http://www.moleculardevices.com). The microarray hybridizations represented 5-8 animals of each breed at all of the time points (0, 14, 21, 25, 29 and 34 dpi) where the CRR served as the reference sample in each case (for a total of 88 slides). Spot features where foreground was less than background plus two standard deviations were flagged as lowly expressed. The linear models for microarray data (LIMMA) package in Bioconductor was used to identify differential gene expression. Background correction was performed according to the robust multichip average (RMA) method. An intensity-based normalization method was employed: within microarray print-tip dependent locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) normalization, followed by between microarray quantile normalization.Less...",GSE14451
Mus musculus,PRJNA108373;,"A relationship exists between nuclear architecture and gene activity and it has been proposed that the activity of ongoing RNA polymerase II transcription determines genome organization in the mammalian cell nucleus. Recently developed 3C and 4C technology allowed us to test the importance of transcription for nuclear architecture. We demonstrate that upon transcription inhibition binding of RNA polymerase II to gene regulatory elements is severely reduced. However, contacts between regulatory DNA elements and genes in the ß-globin locus are unaffected and the locus still interacts with the same genomic regions elsewhere on the chromosome. This is a general phenomenon since the great majority of intra- and interchromosomal interactions with the ubiquitously expressed Rad23a gene are also not affected. Our data demonstrate that without transcription the organization and modification of nucleosomes at active loci and the local binding of specific trans-acting factors is unaltered. We propose that these parameters, more than transcription or RNA polymerase II binding, determine the maintenance of long-range DNA interactions.

Brucella melitensis,PRJNA107509;,"A mini-microarray containing spotted oligos corresponding to 289 B. melitensis genes was used to identify candidate genes whose transcription is influenced by BlxR.  This microarray contains genes encoding the type IV secretion system, flagella, transcriptional regulators, transporters, and proteins involved in outer membrane biogenesis, iron acquisition, and denitrification.  RNA was prepared from both B. melitensis 16M, and the blxR deletion strain, 16M(delta)blxR, grown to late log phase in TSB.
Keywords: genetic modification
Overall design: Bacteria were grown in TSB until mid/late-log phase.  Before RNA isolation, phenol-ethanol (1:19) was added, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at -80°C.  Total RNA was extracted from cell pellets using the MasterPure RNA Purification Kit (Epicentre), and DNA was removed using TURBO DNA-free (Ambion).  cDNA was synthesized from 7 ug of total RNA in the presence of CyDye-3-dCTP (Amersham Biosciences).  The labeled cDNA was purified using the ChipShot cDNA System (Promega).  For each sample, RNA was extracted from two independently grown cultures and cDNA was generated three times for each RNA sample.
For the mini-microarray, 289 potential open reading frames (ORF’s) of the B. melitensis 16M genome were selected based on their hypothesized involvement in virulence.  These included genes for proteins involved in: type IV secretion, flagella, outer membrane biogenesis, transcriptional regulation, denitrification, iron uptake, and peptide and small molecule transport.  Oligonucleotides (70-mers) representing these 289 genes were purchased from Qiagen, re-suspended in 3x SSC, and spotted onto Ultra GAPS coated slides (Corning) using the MicroGrid Microarrayer (Apogent Discoveries).  Slides were desiccated in a vacuum oven with Drierite for 48 h and UV cross linked using a Stratalinker at 600 mJ.  The printing of each ORF spot was verified by hybridizing with Cy3 labeled 9 mer (Qiagen).  The slides were stored under vacuum at room temp with “Drierite” pellets until further use.
16M genomic DNA was labeled by incorporation of CyDye-5-dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) using High Prime DNA Labeling (Roche) according to manufacturer’s instructions.  Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using Micron YM-30 Columns (Millipore).
Cy3-labeled cDNA was mixed with 0.75 ug cy5-labeled gDNA, and hybridization buffer (Pronto Plus Kit, Promega) was added to a final volume of 35 ul.  The entire sample was loaded onto the printed array and covered with a HybriSlip coverslip (Molecular Probes).  Arrays were placed in specialized hybridization chambers (Telechem Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), and incubated at 42°C overnight.  Slides were washed using the Pronto Plus Hybridization System (Promega) and dried by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min.
Slides were scanned using the GenePix4000B scanner (Axon Instruments) with independent excitation of the fluorophores Cy3 and Cy5.  Background intensities for each spot were calculated using GenPixPro 3.0 software (Axon Instruments) via the segmentation method.  The signal intensity for each spot was calculated as the difference between the average signal intensity and the average local background intensity.  Data was normalized to gDNA levels by calculating the ratios of cDNA to gDNA for each spot.  Data was then log2 transformed, and the signal ratio for each spot was divided by the mean signal ratio of the entire array to validate comparisons between different arrays.  Data normalization and statistical analysis were performed using TIGR MeV.

Porphyromonas gingivalis,PRJNA106395;,"Polyphosphate (polyP) is a ubiquitous and abundant compound found in bacteria, fungi, algae, plant, and animals. Among roles of intracellular polyP in bacteria are resistance and survival in the stationary phase of the growth against stress and stringent condition. Therefore, intracellular polyP is considered as a virulence factor of bacteria. In contrast, exogenous polyP has an antimicrobial activity against a variety of microorganisms. To date, much has been numerous studies of antibacterial effect of polyP against gram positive bacteria and fungi while relatively little reports have been published concerning gram negative bacteria. Here we describe bactericidal effect of polyP against gram negative periodontopathic bacterium, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and the transcriptional change by polyP in this bacterium. The bacterial growth was inhibited by polyP (chain length of P3~P75) at concentration of 0.02~0.03%, but not by Pi and PPi at the concentrations. polyP75 was chosen for further experiments, which suppressed the further growth of P. gingivalis as low as 0.03%. polyP75 completely killed the bacterial cells at the concentration of 0.035%. Microarray analysis was employed to identify genes that showed a greater than 1.5-fold difference in the expression by polyP75 at the concentration of 0.03%. It was found that 155 genes were up-regulated and 173 were down-regulated. Down-regulated genes include groups of energy metabolism-related genes, cell envelope-related genes, and genes in relation to biosynthesis of cofactors, prosthetic groups and carriers. Among the down-regulated genes were several involved in DNA replication, cell division protein, and biosynthesis of purines, pyrimidines, nucleosides and nucleotides. In contrast, a large number of ribosomal proteins, transciptional regulators and transposases were up-regulated. Oxidative stress-related genes and iron storage proteins also appeared to be increased in the expression. Real-time PCR confirmed up- and down-regulation of some selected genes. The overall results suggest that polyP has a bactericidal activity against P. gingivalis, interfering with translation, energy metabolism, DNA replication, cell division, and biosynthesis of purines, pyrimidines, nucleoside and nucleotides. polyP may be used as an agent for prevention and treatment of periodontal infections.

Overall design: Twenty μg of each total RNA sample was used in separate hybridization experiments on identical arrays. The whole genome of 1,909 genes of P. gingivalis W83 (GenBank accession no. NC_002950) was submitted to NimbleGen System Inc. (Madison, WI) for microarray design and manufacture using maskless, digital micromirror technology. Five replicates of the genome were included per chip. An average of 19 different 60-base oligonucleotides (60-mer probes) represented each gene in the genome. Sixty-mer probes were selected such that each probe had at least three mismatches compared to all other 60-mers in the target genome. A quality control check (hybridization) was performed for each array, which contained on-chip control oligonucleotides. The arrays were analyzed using an Axon GenePix 4000B microarray scanner with associated software (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Gene expression levels were calculated with NimbleScan Version 2.3 (NimbleGen). Relative signal intensities for each gene were generated using the Robust Multi-Array Average algorithm. The data were processed based on quantile normalization method using the R package. This normalization method aims to make the distribution of intensities for each array in a set of arrays the same.

Design and testing of genome-proxy microarrays to profile marine microbial communities,PRJNA103099;,"Microarrays are useful tools for detecting and quantifying specific functional and phylogenetic genes in natural microbial communities. In order to track uncultivated microbial genotypes and their close relatives in an environmental context, we designed and implemented a “genome proxy” microarray that targets microbial genome fragments recovered directly from the environment. Fragments consisted of sequenced clones from large-insert genomic libraries from microbial communities in Monterey Bay, the Hawaii Ocean Time-series station ALOHA, and Antarctic coastal waters. In a prototype array, we designed probe sets to thirteen of the sequenced genome fragments and to genomic regions of the cultivated cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus MED4. Each probe set consisted of multiple 70-mers, each targeting an individual ORF, and distributed along each ~40-160kbp contiguous genomic region. The targeted organisms or clones, and close relatives, were hybridized to the array both as pure DNA mixtures and as additions of cells to a background of coastal seawater. This prototype array correctly identified the presence or absence of the target organisms and their relatives in laboratory mixes, with negligible cross-hybridization to organisms having ≤~75% genomic identity. In addition, the array correctly identified target cells added to a background of environmental DNA, with a limit of detection of ~0.1% of the community, corresponding to ~10^3 cells/ml in these samples. Signal correlated to cell concentration with an R2 of 1.0 across six orders of magnitude. In addition the array could track a related strain (at 86% genomic identity to that targeted) with a linearity of R2=0.9999 and a limit of detection of ~1% of the community. Closely related genotypes were distinguishable by differing hybridization patterns across each probe set. This array’s multiple-probe, “genome-proxy” approach and consequent ability to track both target genotypes and their close relatives is important for the array’s environmental application given the recent discoveries of considerable intra-population diversity within marine microbial communities.
Keywords: target addition experiment, proof-of-concept for GPL6012
Overall design: ***Overall Array design***

The prototype microarray targeted thirteen BAC or fosmid genome fragments (20-160kb) from both bacteria and archaea, recovered from a variety of marine habitats, as well as the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus MED4. These clones were originally sequenced because of the presence of taxonomic marker or specific functional genes. This array consisted of sets of 70-bp oligonucleotides targeting each genome or genome fragment (Fig. 1), dispersed along the target sequences with no more than one probe per gene, and excluding rRNA genes as targets. The probes were selected solely based on theoretical thermodynamic properties and GC content (~40%); that is, probe selection did not focus on specific genes or regions, but simply produced the “optimal” probes for each genome proxy based on the probes’ predicted hybridization properties. rRNA genes were excluded, because this probe design approach, which avoids sequence alignments and considerations of RNA secondary structure, would be unlikely to result in useful rRNA probes. Furthermore, rRNA probes of traditional design could not be included on the array because their appropriate hybridization conditions would be very different from those of this array’s probes. 

***Microarray probe design***

Microarray 70-mer probes were designed using the program ArrayOligoSelector (Zhu et al., 2003) with the following settings: target %GC = 40%, 1 probe/gene, with the ORFs for each genome fragment as both the input and the database file. The output candidate 70mers were then sorted based on their %GC and those closest to 40% were chosen. In the case of more than the target number of probes having 40%GC, the subset with the lowest free energy of hybridization were selected as probes. Generally, 20 probes were selected per organism. Prochlorococcus MED4 was represented by 60 probes total, 20 each for three different 80kb “genome-proxy” regions: 0-80kb, 1.29-1.37Mbp, and 1.58 to 1.66Mbp. 

Using the same method, a set (n=20) of positive control probes were designed to the genome of the halophillic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1. Negative control probes (n=28) were designed to a set of 49 random 1000-base sequences (Stothard, 2000). 

***Microarray construction and hybridization***

Oligonucleotides were synthesized (Illumina, San Diego, California), suspended in 3XSSC to a concentration of 40pmol/μl, and spotted on homemade poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides using a QArray 2 microarraying robot (Genetix, Hampshire, England). Six replicates of each probe were spotted.

***Microarray data analysis***

Hybridized arrays were scanned using an Axon Instruments 4000B scanner (Foster City, CA) and the data was normalized and filtered using perl scripts written for the purpose, by the following steps. (1) Signal intensities for each spot were calculated by subtracting the local background (mean F532 – median B532, as calculated by GenePix Pro 5.1 software, Axon Instruments). (2) The median value across replicates was calculated for each probe. (3) For each probe set, the number of probes greater than twice the mean negative control signal was calculated, before further processing. (4) Filter I: Arrays with less than half their positive control probes exceeding twice the mean negative control signal were considered poor quality, low dynamic range, arrays and were excluded from further analysis. (5) Each probe signal was corrected for non-specific binding by subtracting the mean negative control spot signal. (6) The data was then normalized for array-to-array variations in brightness by dividing each probe signal by the mean positive control signal. This positive control signal was the mean signal across the Halobacterium salinarum probes in each hybridization, with identical amounts of H. salinarum DNA having been added to each reaction prior to amplification and labeling. (7) Filter II: In order for a genotype to be considered “present”, at least 45% of its probes had to exceed twice the mean negative control signal. (8) Finally, each genotype signal was calculated as either the MEAN or TUKEY BIWEIGHT across its probe set. 

***Experimental Design***

The array was hybridized to laboratory mixtures of cloned environmental genomic DNA targeted by the array, in varying ratios. The use of multiple probes to target many genes from each organism helped to normalize probe-to-probe heterogeneity, by averaging across all probes in a set (as described below). The evenness of probe response across each genotype’s set was also used to evaluate the relatedness of hybridizing DNA. 

To more precisely define the array’s phylogenetic range and specificity, it was tested against DNA from Prochlorococcus MED4 and related strains, spanning the known range of Prochlorococcus phylogenetic diversity. 

To test the effects of hybridization stringency on the specificity and signal of the MED4 probes, Prochlorococcus strains were hybridized at a range of conditions.

To test whether the specificity results for Prochlorococcus were comparable for other targeted clades, two genome fragments recovered from closely related phylotypes within the SAR86 clade of the gamma-proteobacteria were represented on the array, and were tested for specificity.

To understand the equivalence of probe sets targeting different regions of the same organism’s genome, we targeted three 80kb “genome proxy” regions of the Prochlorococcus MED4 genome. One of the regions fell in a genomic “island” where inter-strain variability is concentrated (“ISL5” in Coleman et al., 2006).

To test the array in a complex environmental context, we collected coastal seawater (lacking detectable Prochlorococcus cells by flow cytometry) and added Prochlorococcus cells from strains MED4, MIT9515, MIT9312 and MIT9313 over a range of concentrations from ~101 – 106 cells/ml (Fig. 3). The seawater was then filtered and the DNA extracted, amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the array.Less...",GSE9384
Haemophilus influenzae,PRJNA101265;,"Haemophilus influenzae(Hi) is a gram-negative rod shaped bacterium that lives symbiotically in the upper respiratory tract of humans. Capsulated Hi, as well as non-capsulated strains are known to cause a number of significant infections. Recognizing and understanding the links between the phenotypic traits and the genetic background has paramount epidemiological and clinical importance. To date, a panoply of microbiological and molecular biology tools have been developed and utilized by researchers aimed at identifying the evolutionary links among strains and isolates. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has been shown to be a useful tool for screening strains for their genetic content. However, there is a major limitation when CGH is conducted on a microarray based on a single reference genome. CGH results report which genes are present or absent relative to the genome. Hence the information about novel genetic content that the query strain possesses remains obscure. We report here the construction of the first Hi pan-genome microarray representing ca. 4600 features by 70-mers. In addition to those from the Rd strain, new features originate from the unfinished genome sequences present in NCBI database and from our novel gene discovery project efforts using strain HK1212. Genomes of 20strains belonging to different phylogenetic lineages were screened for their gene loss and gain utilizing the species microarray.  The results obtained by employing the multistrain species microarray provide comprehensive information about the genomic content of uncharacterized strains. The trees generated by CGH, in general, do not reproduce the phylogeny of a species in terms of vertical evolution, but instead represents the overall relatedness of genomes to one another and provide an assessment about the species genome evolution.

The active b-globin locus in fetal liver contacts mostly transcribed, but not necessarily tissue-specific, loci elsewhere on chromosome 7, while the inactive locus in fetal brain contacts different, transcriptionally silent, loci. A housekeeping gene in a gene dense region on chromosome 8 forms long-range contacts predominantly with other active gene clusters, both in cis and in trans, and many of these intra- and interchromosomal interactions are conserved between the tissues analyzed.

Selection of transcription start sites and identification of promoter sequences
We interrogated 5 databases: Ensembl, VEGA, Refseq, ZGC full length clones and a database provided by Dr. Leonard Zon  (Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA) in order to assemble an extensive list of zebrafish transcripts. The Zon lab database is a hand-curated database of zebrafish genes that have homologues in other species. We included all transcripts that appeared in the manually annotated databases (VEGA, Zon) and in the ZGC full length database. We also identified genes present in any 2 of the 5 databases and included those not already selected. The transcripts were mapped to the zebrafish genome (Zv4, June 2004) obtained from UCSC Bioinformatics (http://genome.ucsc.edu) and the transcription start site (TSS) for each transcript was determined. Transcripts with TSSs within 500bp were clustered into a transcriptional unit (TU) and promoter regions were identified relative to the most upstream TSS. This resulted in the identification of 13,413 TUs and corresponding promoter regions.  Each promoter region was extracted and masked for repetitive sequence by RepeatMasker.  If the promoter region contained a gap the upstream sequence was also masked.

60-mer oligonucleotide probes representing the region between 1.5kb upstream and 0.5kb downstream of the annotated TSS of each transcriptional unit were then designed. Although transcription factors and other DNA binding proteins are known to regulate genes from distances of greater than -1.5kb or + 0.5kb, much information can be gained from regions close to the TSS [45],  and the H3K4Me3 mark studied in this paper is found at the most 5’ end of a gene, close to the TSS.

Selection of 60-mers for the microarrays was essentially as described in [14] using the Zv4 build of the zebrafish genome and a locally customized version of ArrayOligoSelector. 60-mers were chosen so that promoter regions contained approximately one probe every 250bp with a maximum distance between probes for each promoter region set at 600bp. In cases where only one probe could be designed for a particular TU these were not included in the final design. This process yielded 80,839 probes for 11,171 promoter regions 

We also incorporated several sets of control probes, both positive and negative. On each array there are 1090 probes designed against ‘gene desert’ regions, which are genomic regions that are unlikely to be bound by transcriptional regulators, and 270 probes designed against Arabidopsis thaliana genes, which are not present in the zebrafish genome (by BLAST). In addition, because our main motivation for making these microarrays is to identify mesodermally-regulated genes we included 7 genes expressed in mesoderm during gastrulation as positive controls (wnt11, flh, vent, msgn1, myod, fgf8, pcdh8). Probes designed against these promoters, which flank from 3-4kb around each TSS, are arrayed 2-4 times on each slide. Since these genes are expressed at gastrula stages to varying degrees, they also serve as a positive controls in this study. Finally there are 2256 controls added by Agilent and a variable number of blank spots. These probes were divided between two microarray slides each with 44,290 features.

We refer to these two microarray slides as the ‘proximal promoter set’. A proximal promoter set based on these designs as well as an expanded set of 9 slides which contain regions from –9kb to + 3kb relative to the TSS, are available by contacting Agilent (www.agilent.com) or by downloading the design files from http://jura.wi.mit.edu/bioc/gbell/zfish_chip/ for self-manufacture.Less...",GSE4863
Poplar flowering and maturation GeneXp arrays,PRJNA93395;,"To identify candidate genes involved in maturation and flowering, we conducted microarray expression studies using two poplar genotypes (Populus trichocarpa x P. deltoides hybrids) represented in continuous age gradients of one to six years. We designed 70-mers for 228 poplar genes and microarray studies were carried out using the microplate-based 96-well BioGridArray platform (GeneXP Biosciences).   Floral buds, vegetative buds and shoot tips were collected at different seasonal time points from juvenile and adult trees and from both basal and upper branches of mature trees.

Overall design: The experiment was carried out using the microplate-based 96-well BioGridArray platform (GeneXP Biosciences).  Each of 228 oligonucletides were duplicated in each well. Two human genes, beta-actin and gapdh , were also printed on all arrays as negative controls.  plus ten arabidopsis oligonucleotides selected by GeneXP and used to measure quality of hybridization. For each of 16 samples, two seperate RNA isolations were performed and were considered as biological replicates. Each biological replicate was labeled with Cy5, and hybridized to duplicated wells.Less...",GSE3457
Homo sapiens,PRJNA87205;,"Samples were purchased from Clontech as mRNA.
Hybridization material was generated through a random-priming amplification procedure (RP-AMP) using primers with a random sequence at the 3' end and a fixed motif at the 5' end.  shDNP256 (first strand synthesis): 5'- TAG ATG CTG TTG NNN NNN NNN -3'  shT7N9 (second strand synthesis): 5'- ACT ATA GGG AGA NNN NNN NNN -3'  1.5  g of mRNA was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II and the DP256 random primer for 20 minutes at 42 C (10 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 8 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dNTPs, 5 U/ l Superscript II). The RNA was  degraded with the addition of 20 l volume of 0.5N sodium hydroxide and 0.25 M EDTA for 20 minutes at 65 C.  The single stranded cDNA was purified using a commercial kit (Qiagen Qiaquick).
The resulting product of single stranded cDNA was placed in its entirety in a second strand reaction. Second strand synthesis reactions utilized shT7N9 random primer and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase utilizing standard reaction conditions (37 C for 60 minutes, 0.2 mM DTT, 2.1 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 2.1 mM MgCl2, 10.7 mM NaCl, 1.07 mM dNTPs, 0.1U/ l Klenow), followed by another Qiaquick purification.  Multiple polymerase chain reactions were run using 0.15  g of double stranded DNA and standard reaction conditions.  Amplification was achieved using 10 cycles of PCR with the DP256 and T7 primers (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.4, 50 mM KCl, 0.01 mM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.01 U/ l Taq Polymerase)  DP256: 5'- GTT CGA GAC CTC TAG ATG CTG TTG -3'  T7: 5'- AA TTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG AGA -3'  followed by Qiaquick purification.
Further amplification was achieved using in vitro transcription reactions with X0.5  g dsDNA and T7 RNA Polymerase (7.5 mM DTT, 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 14.25 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM Spermidine, 125 U/ml RNAguard, 2.5 mM dNTPs, 15 U/ml IPPase, 25kU/ml T7 Polymerase) for 16 hours at 42 C. The cRNA was purified (RNeasy) and  reverse transcribed using Superscript and random 9-mers and amino-allyl dUTP (42 C for 20 minutes, 10 mM DTT, 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 8 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dNTPs, 0.5 mM aa-dUTP, 5 U/ l Superscript II).
The cDNA for each channel was covalently coupled separately with Cy5 and Cy3 monoreactive fluors, respectively, in 1M sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.0, followed by quenching with 4.0 M hydroxylamine. The Cy5 and Cy3 labelled cDNAs were purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit and the percentage dye incorporation and total cDNA yield was determined spectrophotometrically. Cy5 and Cy3 labelled cDNAs were combined and added to 2 mls 30% formamide with Herring Sperm DNA for hybridization to the microarray.

Briefly, an invariant set of probes was selected based on their intensity ranks.  Then, a LOESS regression model was fit for Cy5 vs. Cy3 intensities for all probes in the invariant set.  Finally, for all probes on the array the Cy5 intensities were normalized to the corresponding Cy3 intensities using prediction values from the regression model.
Note that the normalized intensity values given here were used for all analyses reported in the accompanying paper.  The ratio values reported here were not used for the analysis described in the manuscript and are not calculated from the normalized intensity values given below.
