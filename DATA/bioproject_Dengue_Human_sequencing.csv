scRNAseq analysis of DENV-2 infected B cells,PRJNA1158826;,"Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of dengue, a mosquito-borne disease that represents a significant and growing public health burden around the world. A unique pathophysiological feature of dengue is immune-mediated enhancement, wherein preexisting immunity elicited by a primary infection can enhance the severity of a subsequent infection by a heterologous DENV serotype. A leading mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE), where sub-neutralizing concentrations of DENV-specific IgG antibodies facilitate entry of DENV into FcR expressing cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Accordingly, this model posits that phagocytic mononuclear cells are the primary reservoir of DENV. However, analysis of samples from individuals experiencing acute DENV infection reveals that B cells are the largest reservoir of infected circulating cells, representing a disconnect in our understanding of immune-mediated DENV tropism. In this study, we demonstrate that the expression of a DENV-specific B cell receptor (BCR) renders cells highly susceptible to DENV infection, with the infection-enhancing activity of the membrane-restricted BCR correlating with the ADE potential of the IgG version of the antibody. In addition, we observed that the frequency of DENV-infectable B cells increases in previously flavivirus-naïve volunteers after a primary DENV infection. These findings suggest that BCR-dependent infection of B cells is a novel mechanism immune-mediated enhancement of DENV-infection.
Overall design: The DENV-specific B cell line 7B9 was infected with DENV-2 for 24 hrs, washed, then incubated for and additional 24 hours prior to harvest and analysis by scRNAseq. A parallel uninfected/control culture was cultured and analyzed in a parallel fashion.Less...",GSE276766
A novel method for characterizing cell-cell interactions at single-cell resolution reveals unique immune signatures in blood T cell-monocyte complexes during infection (Dengue scRNA-Seq),PRJNA1139796;,"We designed a novel method to study the transcriptome of single cells forming complexes in a high-throughput fashion, without the need for bioinformatic deconvolution. We applied this method to the study of T cells and monocytes forming complexes in blood isolated from individuals with dengue fever, with blood collected at the acute and convalescent phase of infection. We found that the transcriptomic signatures of T cells and monocytes forming complexes significantly overlapped with those identified in T cell-monocyte complexes in active tuberculosis, with upregulation of genes associated with T cell activation, cytotoxicity, cell adhesion and MHC-II. Thus, using our novel method, we identified that T cells and monocyte forming complexes in blood hold unique immune signatures distinct from singlets, and that they may be a previously overlooked valuable biomarker to monitor immune synaptic interactions during infection.
Overall design: PBMC were isolated, cryopreserved and thawed on the day of the experiment. T cell-monocyte complexes were identified by flow cytometry as live CD3+CD14+CD19- events and sorted in bulk. Cell sorting effectively disrupts the physical connection between cells forming complexes, with the vast majority of resulting cells being singlet CD3+ or singlet CD14+ cells remaining in suspension. The single-cell suspension was then used for droplet single-cell sequencing using the 10X genomics platform.

Glycerophospholipid remodeling is critical for orthoflavivirus infection,PRJNA1101937;,"Flavivirus infection is tightly connected to host lipid metabolism. Here, we performed shotgun lipidomics of cells infected with neurotropic Zika, West Nile, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses, as well as dengue and yellow fever virus. Early in infection specific lipids accumulated, e.g., neutral lipids in Zika and some lyso-phospholipids in all infections. Ceramide levels increased following infection with viruses that cause a cytopathic effect. In addition, fatty acid desaturation as well as glycerophospholipid metabolism were significantly altered. Importantly, depletion of enzymes involved in phosphatidylserine metabolism as well as phosphatidylinositol biosynthesis reduced orthoflavivirus titers and cytopathic effects while inhibition of fatty acid monounsaturation only rescued from virus-induced cell death. Interestingly, interfering with ceramide synthesis had opposing effects on virus replication and cytotoxicity depending on the targeted enzyme. Thus, lipid remodeling by orthoflaviviruses includes distinct changes but also common patterns shared by several viruses that are needed for efficient infection and replication.
Overall design: Shotgun lipidomics and transcriptomics of cells infected with neurotropic Zika, West Nile, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses, as well as dengue and yellow fever virus.

Unraveling the Complexity of Chikungunya Virus Infection: immunological and genetic insights in acute and chronic patients,PRJEB74939,"The chikungunya virus (CHIKV), transmitted by infected Aedes mosquitoes, has caused a significant number of infections worldwide. In Brazil, the emergence of the CHIKV-ECSA genotype in 2014 posed a major public health challenge due to its association with more severe symptoms. This study aimed to shed new light on the host immune response by examining the profile of both CHIKV-acute and chronically infected individuals from Feira de Santana, Bahia, Brazil, a region heavily affected by CHIKV, Dengue, and Zika virus epidemics. Our data reveal a complex symptomatology characterized by arthralgia and post-chikungunya neuropathy in chronic individuals, particularly affecting women leaving in socially vulnerable situations. Analysis of genetic modules suggests heightened metabolic processes and cap methylation in acute patients. In contrast, chronic individuals exhibit distinct pattern of histone methylation and T-cells differentiation, alongside alterations in the immunological response. Overall, our findings underscore the intricate nature of disease progression in CHIKV infections, highlighting the diverse scenarios encountered in both acute and chronic stages. Moreover, our identification of new genic modules offers valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms driving these distinct disease manifestations.Less...",
Transcriptional profile of human monocyte-derived macrophages stimulated with Interleukin 27,PRJNA1095003;,"Interleukin 27 (IL-27) is a member of the IL-6 and/or IL-12 family that elicits both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. Interferons (IFNs) are a family of cytokines that activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway to induce an antiviral state in cells. Recent studies have reported that IL-27 also induces a robust antiviral response against diverse viruses, both in vitro and in vivo, suggest that IFNs and IL-27 share many similarities at the functional level. However, it is still unknown how similar or different IFN- and IL-27-dependent signaling pathways are. We reported that IFNs and IL-27 activate JAK-STAT signaling and induce shared pro-inflammatory and antiviral pathways in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), leading to the common and unique expression of inflammatory factors and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Importantly, the ability of IL-27 to induce those responses is independent of IFN induction and cellular lineage. Additionally, functional analysis demonstrated that like IFNs, IL-27-mediated response reduced chikungunya and dengue viruses replication in MDMs. In summary, IL-27 exhibits properties similar to those of all three types of human IFN, including the ability to stimulate a protective antiviral response.
Overall design: Human primary FBS-MDMs cultures (n= 3) were either stimulated or not with 25 ng/mL recombinant-human IL27 for 18 hours and mRNA sequencing was then performed using bulk RNA-seqLess...",GSE262963
Integration of miRNA-lncRNA-gene expression to unveil a regulatory role in dengue severity progression,PRJNA1078747,"This study aimed to enhance the understanding of early mechanisms associated with the progression to severe dengue by analyzing total and small RNA transcriptomes from whole blood samples of Brazilian patients. We simultaneously perform genome-wide miRNA and gene expression analysis of the same patients, providing a comprehensive view of gene regulation in severe dengue across different disease stages. The cohort, comprising 70 individuals, was stratified into three groups based on clinical classification and availability of clinical material: (I) classical DENV infection, (II) WS DENV infection, and (III) severe DENV infection. Group I consisted of 26 subjects, Group II comprised 24 subjects, and Group III included 20 subjects. Whole blood samples (3 mL) were collected from all patients in Tempus tubes following standard procedures. Total RNA was extracted from these samples using the MagMax for Stabilized Blood Tubes RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA, USA) as per the instructions of the manufacturer. Total RNA libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep kit with RiboZero Gold (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) following the protocol of the manufacturer, and sequencing was performed with the Illumina NextSeq 500/550 High Output kit v2.5 (150 Cycles). The small RNA library was prepared using the TruSeq Small RNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) according to the protocol of the manufacturer, and sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq 500/550 High Output kit v2.5 (75 Cycles). Signatures associated with immune response evasion, inflammation modulation, viral entry, spread, and vascular permeability were linked to poor prognosis. Collectively, these findings elucidate features of regulation of gene expression in severe dengue progression, shedding light on factors contributing to worsened prognosis in the studied cohort.Less...",
"Macrophages derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) serve as a high-fidelity cellular model for investigating HIV-1, dengue, and influenza viruses",PRJNA1063364;,"Macrophages are important target cells for diverse viruses, and thus represent a valuable model system for studying virus biology. Isolation of primary human macrophages is done by culture of dissociated tissues or from differentiated blood monocytes, but these methods are both time consuming and result in low numbers of recovered macrophages. Here, we explore whether macrophages derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)—which proliferate indefinitely and potentially provide unlimited starting material— could serve as a faithful model system for studying virus biology. Human iPSC-derived monocytes were differentiated into macrophages and then infected with HIV-1, dengue virus, or influenza virus as model macrophage-tropic human viruses. We show that iPSC-derived macrophages supported the replication of these viruses with similar kinetics and phenotypes to human blood monocyte-derived macrophages. These iPSC-derived macrophages were virtually indistinguishable from human blood monocyte-derived macrophages based on surface marker expression analysis (flow cytometry), transcriptomics (RNA-seq), and chromatin accessibility profiling (ATAC-seq) approaches. iPSC lines were additionally generated from nonhuman primate (chimpanzee) fibroblasts. When challenged with dengue virus, human and nonhuman primate iPSC-derived macrophages show differential susceptibility to infection, thus providing a valuable resource for studying the species-tropism of viruses. Collectively, our results substantiate iPSC-derived macrophages as an alternative to blood monocyte-derived macrophages for the study of virus biology.
Overall design: We differentiated human iPSCs into hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs), then differentiated those HSPCs into monocytes. Monocytes were loosely adherent to the HSPCs  and were readily harvested by gentle washing of the cell monolayer with growth media every 4-5 days, followed by media replacement for continued growth.  We next confirmed that iPSC derived monocytes could differentiate into macrophages and polarize into phenotypically distinct subtypes. Adherent monocytes were treated with macrophage colony stimulating factor for four days to generate naïve macrophages. M0 macrophages were then polarized into M1 or M2 subsets using interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide or interleukin-4, respectively. To examine whether blood- and iPSC-derived macrophages exhibit similar transcriptional profiles, we carried out transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility analyses of all cell types during differentiation and subsequent polarization via RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin-sequencing (ATAC-seq).Less...",GSE252979
Unravelling tRNA Fragments in DENV Pathogenesis: Insights from RNA Sequencing,PRJNA1026910;,"tRNA-derived small RNA including tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) and tRNA halves (tiRNAs) plays significant roles in the various molecular mechanisms that underlie certain human diseases. of the generation of tRFs/tiRNAs and their potential roles during Dengue virus (DENV) infection is not yet known.  Here, we have performed small RNA sequencing to identify the generation and alterations in tRF expression profiles of DENV infected Huh7 cells. Our results suggest that 733 tiRNAs/tRFs were found to be differentially expressed during DENV infection. Interestingly, 3’tRF population were found to be upregulated and i-tRF population were found to be downregulated. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were performed to analyze the impact of differentially expressed tRFs on DENV pathogenesis. Our results suggest the significant involvement in transcriptional regulation via RNA polymerase II promoter and metabolic pathways. Overall, our study contributes significantly to our understanding of the roles played by tRFs in the complex dynamics of DENV infection.
Overall design: we conducted a comprehensive RNA sequencing analysis to decipher the distinctive patterns of tRFs/tiRNAs in DENV-infected Huh7 cell lines relative to mock-infected controls. For RNA sequencing, triplicate samples were provided of Mock infected Huh7 cells, 0hr DENV infected Huh7 cells (i.e. 2 hrs post adsorption) and48hrs DENV ijfected Huh7 cells.Less...",GSE245081
Homo sapiens,PRJNA1020645,"Dengue virus (DENV) causes approximately 390 million dengue infections worldwide every year. There were 22,777 reported DENV infections in Tainan, Taiwan in 2015. In this study, 129 DENV were isolated from 628 patient sera. Sequencing of C, prM, and E genes from 45 DENV strains was performed and phylogenetic analysis based on C-prM-E genes revealed that all strains were classified as DENV serotype 2 Cosmopolitan genotype. Compared with other genotypes, several variations were found. The major substitution was C-A314G (K73R) found in the capsid region, however, reverse genetics virus rgC-A314G (K73R) showed slower replication in BHK-21 and C6/36 cells when compared with the wildtype virus. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of three sera collected from one DENV-infected patient at different time-points showed that the number of haplotypes decreased with time in the DENV-infected patient. On the fifth day after admission, two new haplotypes emerged whereby leucine mutated to isoleucine and was identified in NS4A-115. Quasispecies analysis of DENV-1, -2, and -3 revealed that the variations were all located in the nonstructural protein region of the genome, namely NS2B, NS3, and NS4A. In conclusion, a newly emerged substitution in the capsid region was found in the 2015 isolates. This C-A314G (K73R) substitution showed lower replication rate and stability than wildtype virus, thus indicating that the other variants in the viral population may contribute to the 2015 outbreak. Additionally, haplotype analysis showed that the DENV viral population continually changes overtime to adapt to its environment.Less...",

Global and cell type-specific immunological hallmarks of severe dengue progression,PRJNA912187;,"Dengue virus (DENV) causes widespread mosquito-borne infection. While most symptomatic patients experience mild disease, a fraction progresses to severe dengue (SD)--a life-threatening condition whose pathogenesis remains largely unknown. We integrated virus-inclusive single cell RNA-Seq 2 (viscRNA-Seq 2) with functional assays to determine the immunological hallmarks of SD progression in children’s blood. We show that beyond myeloid cells, in natural infection, B cells harbor replicating DENV capable of infecting permissive cells. Alterations in cell abundance, gene and protein expression and secretion, and cell-cell communications suggesting increased migration and inflammation in SD progressors, yet concurrent: i) impaired interferon responses and antigen presentation, in part DENV-modulated, by antigen presenting cells (APCs) in face of intact uptake; ii) activation, regulation, and exhaustion of effector responses, enhanced IFNγ-responses, and appearance of HLA-DR-expressing NK cells possibly compensating for APCs impairments. These observations reveal the target cells of DENV in human blood and provide insight into SD pathogenesis beyond antibody-mediated enhancement.

Immune metabolic interplay drives the protective antibody response pre-vaccination with Dengue virus Vaccine,PRJNA862372;,"Protective immunity to dengue virus (DENV) requires antibody response to all four serotypes. Systems vaccinology identified pre-vaccination mechanisms predictive of broad antibody responses after immunization with a tetravalent live-attenuated DENV vaccine candidate (Butantan-DV/TV003). Anti-inflammatory pathways including TGF-b signaling expressed by CD68low monocytes and the metabolokines phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were positively correlated with broadly neutralizing Ab responses against DENV. In contrast expression of pro-inflammatory pathways and cytokines (IFN, IL-1) in CD68hi monocytes and primary and secondary bile acids negatively correlated with broad DENVDENV specific Ab responses. Induction of TGF-b and IFNs respectively by PC/PE and bile acids in CD68low and CD68hi monocytes and their impact on viral sensing was confirmed in vitro. We show that the balance between metabolites and pro- or anti-inflammatory innate immune cells drives broad and protective B cell response to the live-attenuated dengue vaccine.

Transcriptional and Translational Dynamics of Zika and Dengue Virus Infection,PRJNA854905;,"Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are members of the Flaviviridae family of RNA viruses and cause severe disease in humans. ZIKV and DENV share over 90% of their genome sequences, however the clinical features of Zika and dengue infections are very different reflecting tropism and cellular effects. Here, we used simultaneous RNA sequencing and ribosome footprinting to define the transcriptional and translational dynamics of ZIKV and DENV infection in human neuronal progenitor cells (hNPCs). The gene expression data showed induction of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (ARS) and the translation-activating PIM1 kinase indicating an increase in RNA translation capacity. The data also reveal activation of different cell stress reponses, with ZIKV triggering a BACH1/2 redox program, and DENV activating the ETF/CHOP endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress program. The RNA translation data highlight activation of polyamine metabolism through changes in key enzymes and their regulators. This pathway is needed for eIF5A hypusination and has been implicated viral translation and replication. Concerning the viral RNA genomes, ribosome occupancy readily identifies highly translated open reading frames and a novel upstream ORF (uORF) in the DENV genome. Together, our data highlight both the cellular stress response and also the activation of RNA translation and polyamine metabolism during DENV and ZIKV infection.

The exosomal miRNAs signatures during disease progression in dengue virus infection,PRJEB47063,"Dengue virus is a causative agent of the dengue fever, a most common mosquito transmitted disease. As an epidemic disease, dengue has put almost half of the world’s population at risk. With the lack of specific treatment and effective vaccine, it is most important to diagnose and prognose the disease as early as possible. Based on its severity, dengue infection has been categorized into 3 group plans viz. WHO Plan A (dengue without warning), WHO Plan B (dengue with warning) and WHO Plan C (Dengue haemorrhagic fever). During the dengue infection as it progresses to severe form of infection, there will be a change in microRNA profile within the cell which will be reflected on the exosomes secreted by the cells. Hence, in this study, we would like to examine the exosome-associated microRNA in human patients’ serum samples at different stages (Plan A, Plan B and Plan C) of dengue infection as compared to healthy control. This would help us in identifying miRNA that are unique to dengue infection as well as that would help us in identifying the prognosis marker for early detection of disease severity.Less...",
The serum mRNA profile during disease progression in dengue virus infection,PRJEB47146,"Dengue virus infection can be classified into 3 different groups based on disease severity (Plan A, Plan B and Plan C). As the disease progresses to a severe infection, there will be change in the profile of the secretory mRNAs in the patient’s serum.

Hence, in this study we wanted to examine the secretory mRNAs in human patient serum samples at different stages (Plan A, Plan B and Plan C) of dengue infection as compared to healthy control. This may help us in identifying the secretory mRNAs that are differentially regulated in dengue infection and how they help in progression to severe dengue.Less...",

Homo sapiens,PRJNA812009,"Mosquito-borne viruses continue to cause significant global morbidity and mortality, particularly in Southeast Asia. When mosquitoes deliver the virus into the skin of humans while probing for a blood meal, they deposit also saliva, which contains a myriad of pharmacologically active compounds that modulate the host immune system. Little is known about skin immunity to mosquito saliva, particularly in endemic volunteers as most clinical studies are performed in na(SqrRoot) ve individuals who have never or rarely been exposed to a particular mosquito vector. People living in endemic areas have had long-term repeated exposure to these vectors and therefore have different immune response to mosquito saliva, which could interfere with mosquito-borne disease vaccine effectiveness. Characterization of skin immunity via various technical modalities will be important in order to identify critical aspects of the innate and adaptive immune responses after a vector bite.Here, we will execute a paired study of exposed-unexposed skin to carefully examine the innate and adaptive immune responses in the skin and blood to exposure of the saliva of Aedes aegypti, the mosquito vector of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. We will enroll 42 participants to undergo vector feeding and give blood samples at baseline and 2 and 14 days later. Additionally, participants will give skin punch biopsy samples of bitten (exposed) and unbitten (unexposed) skin.

Broadly neutralizing human antibodies against dengue virus identified by single B cell transcriptomics,PRJNA793910,"Eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against the four dengue virusserotypes (DENV1-4) that are spreading into new territories is an important goal of vaccine design. To define bNAb targets, we characterized 28 antibodies belonging to expanded and hypermutated clonal families identified by transcriptomic analysis of single plasmablasts from DENV-infected individuals. Among these, we identified J9 and J8, two somatically related bNAbs that potently neutralized DENV1-4. Mutagenesis studies showed that the major recognition determinants of these bNAbs are in E protein domain I, distinct from the only known class of human bNAbs against DENV with a well-defined epitope. B cell repertoire analysis from acute-phase peripheral blood suggested that J9 and J8 followed divergent somatic hypermutation pathways, and that a limited number of mutations was sufficient for neutralizing activity. Our study suggests multiple B cell evolutionary pathways leading to DENV bNAbs targeting a new epitope that can be exploited for vaccine design.Less...",

Multi-tissue transcriptomic-informed in silico investigation of drugs for the treatment of dengue fever disease,PRJEB46564,"Transcriptomics, proteomics and pathogen-host interactomics data is being explored for in silico informed-selection of drugs, prior to its functional evaluation. The effectiveness of this kind of strategy has been put into test in the current COVID-19 pandemic, and it has been paying off, leading to a few drugs being rapidly repurposed as treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several neglected tropical diseases, for which treatment remains unavailable, would benefit from informed in silico investigations of drugs, as we tried to perform in this work for dengue fever disease. We analysed transcriptomic data in the key tissues of liver, spleen and blood profiles, and verified that despite transcriptomic differences due to tissue specialization, the common mechanisms of action “Adrenergic receptor antagonist”, “ATPase inhibitor”, “NF-kB pathway inhibitor” and “Serotonin receptor antagonist” were identified as druggable (e.g. oxprenolol, digoxin, auranofin and palonosetron, respectively) to oppose the effects of severe dengue infection in these tissues.

A population of CD4+CD8+ double-positive T cells associated with risk of plasma leakage in dengue viral infection,PRJNA737798;,"According to the WHO 2009 classification, dengue with warning signs (D+W) is at the risk of developing severe form of dengue disease. One of the most important warning signs is plasma leakage, which is a serious complication associated with higher morbidity and mortality. We report that the frequency of CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) T cells is significantly increased in patients at risk of developing plasma leakage. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that CD4+CD8+ DP cells were distinct from CD4+ Single Positive (SP) T cells, but co-clustered with CD8+ SP cells indicating a largely similar transcriptional profile. 20 significant differentially expressed (DE) genes were identified between CD4+CD8+ DP and CD8+ SP cells. These genes encode OX40 and CCR4 (TNFRSF4 and CCR4), as well as other molecules associated with cell signaling on the cell surface (NT5E, MXRA8, PTPRK). While 5 significant DE genes were identified, the profile of gene expression in CD4+CD8+ DP cells was mostly similar between patients with and without warning signs of plasma leakage, implying a role of CD4+CD8+ DP cells in plasma leakage through a quantitative increase rather than functional alteration. The differentially expressed genes identified could have diagnostic utility, perhaps as PCR-based diagnostic markers.

Dengue and Zika RNA-RNA interactomes reveal virus permissive and restrictive factors in human cells.,PRJNA736235;,"Identifying host factors is key to understanding RNA virus pathogenicity. Besides proteins, RNAs can interact with virus genomes to impact replication. Here, we used proximity ligation sequencing to identify virus-host RNA interactions for four strains of Zika virus (ZIKV) and one strain of dengue virus (DENV-1) in human cells. We found hundreds of coding and non-coding RNAs that bind to DENV and ZIKV viruses. Host RNAs tend to bind to single-stranded regions along the virus genomes and the binding is primarily driven by hybridization energetics. We observed that virus interacting host RNAs tend to be downregulated upon virus infection and identified a conserved set of virus responders that binds to most DENV and ZIKV. Knockdown of several short non-coding RNAs, including miR19a-3p, SCARNA2 and 7SK RNA resulted in a decrease in virus growth, suggesting that they act as virus permissive factors. In addition, the 3’UTR of DYNLT1 mRNA acts as a virus restrictive factor by binding to the conserved dumbbell region on DENV and ZIKV 3’UTR to decrease virus replication.

Transcriptomic analysis of DENV-specific CD8+T cell responses in acute disease does not support qualitative differences as drivers of disease severity,PRJNA730030;,"In this study, we assessed the contribution of dengue-specific CD8+T cells in hospitalized samples with mild (dengue fever; DF) and severe (dengue hemorrhagic fever; DHF) forms of the disease. Our in-depth transcriptomic analysis provides no evidence for qualitative differences in terms of CD8+T cell response against dengue, therefore, concluding that CD8+T cell response is not a contributing factor in the development of severe dengue disease.
Overall design: 40 individuals that required hospitalization due to DENV infection (based on clinical diagnosis and being positive either with PCR or IgM serology assay), have been enrolled and the corresponding blood samples were collected during hospitalization and during a follow up visit in convalescent phase.

Specific Interaction of DDX6 with an RNA Hairpin in the 3?-UTR of the Dengue Genome Mediates G1 Phase Arrest,PRJNA716981;,"The extent to which viral genomic RNAs interact with host factors and contribute to host response and disease pathogenesis is not well known. Here, we report that the human RNA helicase DDX6 specifically binds to the viral most conserved RNA hairpin in the A3 element in the dengue 3´-UTR, with nanomolar affinities. DDX6 CLIP confirmed the interaction in HuH-7 cells infected by dengue virus serotype 2. This interaction requires three conserved residues, Lys307, Lys367, and Arg369, as well as the unstructured extension in the C-terminal domain of DDX6. Interestingly, alanine substitution of these three basic residues resulted in RNA-independent ATPase activity, suggesting a mechanism by which RNA-binding and ATPase activities are coupled in DEAD-box helicases. Furthermore, we applied a cross-omics gene enrichment approach to suggest that DDX6 is functionally related to cell cycle regulation and viral pathogenicity. Indeed, infected cells exhibited cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and a decrease in the early S phase. Exogeneous expression of intact DDX6, but not A3-binding-deficient mutants, alleviated these effects by rescue of the DNA pre-initiation complex expression. Disruption of the DDX6-binding site was found in dengue and Zika live-attenuated vaccine strains. Our results suggested that dengue virus has evolved an RNA aptamer against DDX6 to alter host cell states, and defined DDX6 as a new regulator of G1/S transition.

Innate Lymphoid Cells Activation and Transcriptomic Changes in Response to Human Dengue Infection,PRJNA655190;,"Background: Dengue virus (DENV) infection has a global impact on public health. The clinical outcomes (of DENV) can vary from a flu-like illness called dengue fever (DF), to a more severe form, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The underlying innate immune mechanisms leading to protective or detrimental outcomes have not been fully elucidated. Helper innate lymphoid cells (hILCs), an innate lymphocyte recently discovered, functionally resemble T-helper cells and are important in inflammation and homeostasis. However, the role of hILCs in DENV infection had been unexplored.
Methods: We performed flow cytometry to investigate the frequency and phenotype of hILCs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from DENV-infected patients of different disease severities (DF and DHF), and at different phases (febrile and convalescence) of infection. Intracellular cytokine staining of hILCs from DF and DHF were also evaluated by flow cytometry after ex vivo stimulation. Further, the hILCs were sorted and subjected to transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression analysis was performed to compare the febrile and convalescent phase samples in DF and DHF. Selected differentially expressed genes were then validated by quantitative PCR.
Results: Phenotypic analysis showed marked activation of all three hILC subsets during the febrile phase as shown by higher CD69 expression when compared to paired convalescent samples, although the frequency of hILCs remained unchanged. Upon ex vivo stimulation, hILCs from febrile phase DHF produced significantly higher IFN-g and IL-4 when compared to those of DF. Transcriptomic analysis showed unique hILCs gene expression in DF and DHF, suggesting that divergent functions of hILCs may be associated with different disease severities. Differential gene expression analysis indicated that hILCs function both in cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity during the febrile phase of DENV infection.
Conclusions: Helper ILCs are activated in the febrile phase of DENV infection and display unique transcriptomic changes as well as cytokine production that correlate with severity. Targeting hILCs during early innate response to DENV might help shape subsequent immune responses and potentially lessen the disease severity in the future.

Temporally integrated single cell RNA sequencing analysis of controlled and natural DENV-1 infections,PRJNA646102;,"Controlled dengue human challenge studies present a unique opportunity to address many longstanding questions in the field of flavivirus biology. These fundamental questions include defining the early immunological signatures of infection, the host/environmental factors that impact disease severity, and the role of preexisting immunity on the development of symptomatic viral infection. However, while several controlled dengue human challenge studies have been performed and appear to clinically recapitulate may features of mild natural DENV infection, limited data are available on how the immunological and transcriptional response elicited by these attenuated challenge viruses compares to the profile associated with a natural, unattenuated DENV infection. To bridge this knowledge gap, we performed scRNAseq analysis on longitudinally collected PBMC samples obtained from 3 individuals (8 time points per subject) enrolled in the SUNY/WRAIR DENV-1 controlled human challenge study. In addition, 3 time points (two acute infection time points, one control time point) from two individuals experiencing a natural DENV-1 infection were analyzed and computationally integrated with the challenge model dataset. This temporally integrated dataset contains a total of 171,208 cells and 22 statistically distinct populations corresponding to all major anticipated leukocyte subsets. While all identified cell populations demonstrated significant and consistant perturbations in their transcriptional profile in response to either natural or experimental DENV infection, conventional monocytes respond most robustly to infection across all subjects and study groups from an unbiased transcriptional perspective. Using these data, core sets of genes that were consistently induced by either natural or experimental DENV were identified, and the overlap between the two arms of the study assessed.

Metabolites and gut microbial composition among leptospirosis patients,PRJNA608796,"The diagnosis of human leptospirosis diagnosis is challenging the disease has similar clinical presentations to other infectious diseases such as dengue and influenza. Current laboratory diagnostic tests for leptospirosis based on the detection of antigen, antibodies and DNA signatures are generally plagued by low sensitivity and specificity. Metabolomics and metagenomics have been suggested to be used as diagnostic tools for some infectious diseases. The revealing of fascinating changes between potential and expressed biochemical pathways detected in microbial communities can be achieved through the combination of both omics. In this study, we characterised the faecal and urine metabolomic profiles of leptospirosis patients. The faecal bacterial composition was elucidated using PacBio-based next-generation sequencing. Using Partial Least Square analysis of the urine and faeces metabolome, a significant separation between leptospirosis patients and healthy subjects was observed. Few metabolites were found to be overly abundant only in among leptospirosis patients. They were found to harbour significantly different bacterial composition as opposed to healthy subjects. A significantly higher number of Ruminococcus gnavus was detected among them and higher Enterobacter in the healthy subjects. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of human metabolomics and metagenomics using long 16S amplicon library approximate 1500bp for leptospirosis.

Altered m6A Modification of Specific Cellular Transcripts Affects Flaviviridae Infection,PRJNA576915;,"The RNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) can modulate mRNA fate and thus affect many biological processes. We analyzed m6A modification across the transcriptome following infection by dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). We found that infection by these viruses in the Flaviviridae family alters m6A modification of specific cellular transcripts, including RIOK3 and CIRBP. During viral infection, the addition of m6A to RIOK3 promotes its translation, while loss of m6A in CIRBP promotes alternative splicing. Importantly, we found that viral activation of innate immune sensing or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response contributes to the changes in m6A modification in RIOK3 and CIRBP, respectively. Further, several transcripts with infection-altered m6A profiles, including RIOK3 and CIRBP, encode proteins that influence DENV, ZIKV, and HCV infection. Overall, this work reveals that cellular signaling pathways activated during viral infection lead to alterations in m6A modification of host mRNAs to regulate infection.

Virus-Host Interactome Reveals the Unique Blockage of Host RNAi Machinery by the Zika Virus Capsid,PRJNA565978;,"The recent outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its association with birth defects known as Congenital Zika Syndrome warrant investigation on the molecular processes related to its infection and pathogenesis. Among the flavivirus family, only ZIKV is linked to microcephaly as announced by World Health Organization, suggesting uniqueness of ZIKV infection compared to other members. By analyzing the ZIKV-host interactome, we found that the key microRNA (miRNA) processing enzyme Dicer was a leading target of ZIKV capsid protein in neural stem cells (NSCs), and its deficiency facilitated ZIKV infection. Mechanistically, ZIKV capsid can directly interact with Dicer and block its ribonuclease activity, dampening the production of host miRNAs that are essential for neurogenesis. Interestingly, this capsid-mediated immune evasion is specific to ZIKV because capsid proteins from other close flaviviruses, e.g., dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses, cannot bind to Dicer or inhibit its function. By molecular mapping, we defined a ZIKV capsid H41R mutant with loss of interaction to Dicer and no longer affecting its activity. More importantly, ZIKV H41R mutant exerted almost no impact on neurogenesis in vitro when expressed in NSCs compared to wild type capsid, and in utero infection of recombinant ZIKV-H41R mutant virus resulted in less inhibition on corticogenesis than wild-type ZIKV in mouse embryos. Interestingly, the epidemic ZIKV strain reinforces the capsid-Dicer interaction by two amino acid substitution compared to ancient Africa strain. Thus, our study demonstrated that capsid-dependent suppression of Dicer function is a unique determinant of ZIKV immune evasion and pathogenesis, which may unveil a new mechanism for ZIKV-mediated microcephaly.

Effect of zinc chelation in Caco-2 cells,PRJNA560386;,"To identify the molecular pathways that are perturbed due to transient zinc chelation
Zinc is known to regulate the functions of about 10% of the human proteome and a large number of physiological processes that are zinc dependent have been identified and characterized under conditions of zinc deficiency and supplementation. As zinc homeostasis is closely linked to the normal functioning of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, many pathogens are directly or indirectly affected by perturbations in zinc homeostasis. Dengue virus (DENV), a mosquito-borne, positive-strand RNA virus from the family Flaviviridae, has emerged as one of the major public health concerns in India and recent estimates suggest that over 60 million people globally get infected with DENV every year. The crystal structures of NS5 protein of DENV and West Nile virus have identified zinc binding site in RdRp domain and propose an important structural role for zinc ions in polymerase activity. Therefore, we investigated whether perturbation in intracellular zinc pools influence dengue infection. We utilized N,N,N’,N’-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (TPEN), a zinc-specific chelator, to mimic zinc-deficiency in cell culture models of infection and investigated the effect of zinc depletion on DENV life-cycle.

Viral Mimicry by Endogenous Y-RNAs Contributes to Antiviral Immunity [DV-4],PRJNA556650;,"Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) protect against host invasion by detecting specific molecular patterns found in pathogens and initiating an immune response. While microbial-derived PRR ligands have been extensively characterized, the contribution and relevance of endogenous ligands to PRR activation during viral infection remain overlooked. In this work, we characterize the landscape of endogenous ligands that engage RIG-I-like receptors upon infection by a positive-sense RNA virus, a negative-sense RNA virus or a retrovirus. We found that several endogenous RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase 3 (Pol3), and in particular the Y-RNA family of small non-coding repeats, bind and activate RIG-I. We show that this recognition is dependent on Y-RNA mimicking viral secondary structure and its 5’-triphosphate extremity. Further, we found that HIV-1 infection triggers a VPR-dependent downregulation of RNA triphosphatase DUSP11 in vitro and in vivo, leading to an increase of Y-RNA 5’-triphosphorylation that enables their immunogenicity. Importantly, we show that altering DUSP11 expression is sufficient to induce a type-I interferon and T cell activation transcriptional program associated with HIV-1 infection. Overall, our work uncovers the critical contribution of endogenous RNAs ligands to antiviral immunity and demonstrates the role of this pathway in HIV-1 infection.

Flavivirus induces and antagonizes antiviral RNA interference in both mammals and mosquitoes,PRJNA550985;,"Mosquito-borne flaviviruses maintain life cycles in mammals and mosquitoes. RNA interference (RNAi) has been demonstrated as an anti-flavivirus mechanism in mosquitoes; however, whether and how flavivirus induces and antagonizes RNAi-mediated antiviral immunity in mammals remains unknown. Here we showed that NS2A of Dengue virus-2 (DENV2) act as a viral suppressor of RNAi (VSR). When NS2A-mediated RNAi suppression was disabled, the resulting mutant DENV2 induced Dicer-dependent production of abundant DENV2-derived siRNAs in differentiated mammalian cells. Importantly, VSR-disabled DENV2 showed severe replication defects in mosquito and mammalian cells, and mice, which were rescued by the deficiency of RNAi. Moreover, NS2As of multiple flaviviruses act as VSRs in vitro and during viral infection in both organisms. Overall, our findings demonstrate that antiviral RNAi can be induced by flavivirus, while flavivirus uses NS2A as bona fide VSR to evade RNAi in mammals and mosquitoes, highlighting the importance of RNAi in flaviviral vector-host life cycles.

Molecular signatures of dengue virus-specific IL-10/IFN-γ co-producing CD4 T cells and their association with severe dengue disease,PRJNA547763;,"Dengue virus (DENV) infection is associated with a range of clinical manifestations, from self-limiting dengue fever (DF) to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Although DENV-specific CD4 T cells are capable of producing inflammatory cytokines and can acquire cytotoxic functions in previously DENV-exposed individuals, much less is known related to DENV-specific CD4 T cells during acute DENV infection and disease. In this study, we set out to characterize the immune signatures of DENV-specific CD4 T cells during acute infection and investigate whether DENV-specific CD4 T cell response differs between DF and DHF. Previous studies suggest that increased IL-10 level in the blood is associated with severe dengue disease. Here we show evidence of DENV-specific IL-10-producing CD4 T cells during acute DENV infection. More specifically, an IL-10+IFN-γ+ double positive (DP) CD4 T cell population was prominent in acute hospitalized DENV cases but disappeared at the convalescent stage. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that these cells were associated with gene signatures that marginally overlapped with previously identified signatures of cytotoxic CD4 T cells and type 1 regulatory T (Tr1)-like cells. However, the majority of the genes differentially expressed by DP cells were not related to cytotoxic CD4 T cells or Tr1-like cells. These genes include IL-21, IL-22, CD86, CD109, and CCR1, which are involved in T cell activation, function, cytokine signaling, and migration. Notably, the magnitude of DP cell response was higher in DHF than DF, whereas the gene expression profile of DP cells was similar between DF and DHF. Finally, our data show that DENV-specific DP cells are largely homogeneous based on the expression of 31 selected markers. Overall, this study reveals unique phenotypes of virus-specific IL-10/IFN-γ co-producing CD4 cells and indicates that the quantity but not quality of these cells may be positively correlated with dengue disease severity.

Human Megakaryocytes Possess Intrinsic Anti-Viral Immunity through Regulated Induction of IFITM3,PRJNA517714,"Evolving evidence indicates that platelets and megakaryocytes (MKs) have unexpected activities in inflammation and infection; but whether viral infections upregulate biologically active, anti-viral immune genes in platelets and MKs is unknown. We examined anti-viral immune genes in these cells in dengue and influenza infections, viruses that are global public health threats. Using complementary biochemical, pharmacological, and genetic approaches, we examined the regulation and function of interferon induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), an anti-viral immune effector gene not previously studied in human platelets and MKs. IFITM3 was markedly upregulated in platelets isolated from patients during clinical influenza and dengue (DENV) infections. Lower IFITM3 expression in platelets correlated with illness severity and mortality in patients. Administering a live, attenuated DENV vaccine to healthy donors significantly increased platelet IFITM3 expression. Infecting human MKs with DENV selectively increased type I interferons (IFNs) and IFITM3. Overexpression of IFITM3 in MKs was sufficient to prevent DENV infection. In naturally-occurring, genetic loss-of-function studies MKs from healthy donors harboring a homozygous mutation in IFITM3 (rs12252-C, a common SNP in areas of the world where DENV is endemic) were significantly more susceptible to DENV infection. DENV-induced MK secretion of IFNs prevented infection of bystander MKs and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Thus, viral infections upregulate IFITM3 in human platelets and MKs, and IFITM3 expression is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. These observations establish, for the first time, that human MKs possess anti-viral functions, preventing DENV infection of MKs and HSCs following local immune signaling.Less...",
Chronic Dengue Encephalitis in a Patient with Progressive Dementia,PRJNA507605;,"Dengue virus is the most common arbovirus worldwide and represents a significant public health concern. To date, chronic Dengue infections have not been previously reported. While investigating the etiology of central nervous system (CNS) disease in a patient presenting with progressive dementia, we elucidated a chronic dengue infection within the CNS. Comprehensive viral immune responses in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were profiled by a phage-display assay (VirScan). Enrichment of Dengue viral antibodies were detected in the CSF as compared to the serum. No virus was detected in serum or CSF, but post-mortem analysis confirmed Dengue virus in the brain by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry, RNAscope and sequencing. Dengue virus was detectable by PCR and sequencing from brain biopsy tissue collected 33 months ante-mortem, confirming a chronic infection. Comprehensive antibody profiling assays can aid in the diagnosis of encephalitis of unknown etiologies. Our findings suggest that Dengue virus infections may persist in the CNS and should be considered in patients with progressive dementia in endemic regions or with relevant travel history.

"Molecular alterations induced by Yersinia pestis, dengue virus and Staphylococcus enterotoxin B under the background of battlefield-like stress (miRNA-Seq)",PRJNA482157;,"Background: Severe stress can have drastic and systemic effects with dire implications on the health and wellbeing of exposed individuals.  Particularly, the effect of stress on the immune response to infection is of interest because of its implications for vaccine efficacy and treatment strategy during stressful scenarios. Battlefield-like stress has previously been shown to cause an anergic state in the immune system that persists following exposure to a potent mitogen.
Methods: Genome-wide alterations of gene expression were characterized using leukocytes collected from (15 informed and consented, all male) U.S. Army Ranger cadets immediately before and after training followed by exposure to a representative group of pathogens Yersinia pestis, dengue virus, Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB).  We employed experimental and computational approaches in identifying altered molecules, processes, pathways, and functional and regulatory networks mediating the host’s response towards battlefield-like stress, in assessing protective immunity status of the stressed host towards infection, and in identifying pathogen-induced biomarkers under severe stress background.
Results: We observed predicted inhibition of pathways significantly associated with lymphopoiesis, wound healing, inflammatory response, lymphocyte activation, apoptosis, and predicted activation of oxidative stress.  Using weighted correlation network analyses, we showed preservation of these pathways across infection plus stress combinations.  Regulatory networks comprising a common set of upstream regulators: transcription factors, microRNAs and post-translational regulators (kinases, phosphatases) may be drivers of molecular alterations leading compromised protective immunity.  Other sets of transcripts were persistently altered in both the pre- and post-stress conditions due to the host’s response to each pathogen forming pathogen-specific molecular signatures with a potential to distinguish infection from that of severe stress.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that severe battlefield-like stress alters molecular players implicated in the developments of hematopoietic stem cells probably leading to depletion of cellular and molecular repertoires of protective immunity, membrane trafficking of recycling endosomes and membrane translocation of the antigen processing mechanisms leading to suboptimal antigen processing and presentation, cell adhesion leading to impaired formation of productive immunological synapse,  and inhibited T-cell activation.  These factors may collectively be responsible for compromised protective immunity (infection susceptibility, delayed wound healing and poor vaccine response), and cellular anergy.
Overall design: Subjects (RASP cadets) were exposed to eight weeks of severe stress (RASP training stressors). Plasma was obtained from whole blood samples collected immediately before and after training. MicroRNA were isolated from plasma and sequenced.Less...",GSE117464
Dengue virus-specific CD8 T cell subsets are associated with specialized gene expression profiles and TCR repertoires,PRJNA480690;,"Accumulating evidence demonstrates that CD8 T cells contribute to protection from severe DENV disease and vaccine efficacy. Nevertheless, the molecular programs associated with DENV-specific CD8 T cell subsets have not been defined. Here, we studied the transcriptomic profiles of human DENV-specific CD8 T cells isolated after stimulation with DENV epitopes from donors that have been infected with DENV multiple times and should therefore associated with significant levels of adaptive immunity. DENV-specific CD8 T cells mainly consist of effector memory subsets, namely Tem and Temra which enact specific gene expression profiles upon stimulation with cognate antigens. DENV-specific CD8 T cell subsets in general, and Temra cells in particular, are fully activated and polyfunctional, yet associated with relatively narrow transcriptional responses and TCR repertoires. This study provides the first transcriptomic definition of DENV-specific activated human CD8 T cell subsets and defines a bench mark profile that vaccine-specific response could aim to reproduce.

In vivo molecular signatures of severe dengue infection revealed by viscRNA-Seq,PRJNA479871;,"Dengue virus infection can result in severe symptoms including shock and hemorrhage, but an understanding of the molecular correlates of disease severity is lacking. Bulk transcriptomics on blood samples are difficult to interpret because the blood is composed of different cell types that may react differently to virus infection. Dengue virus RNA can be detected in human plasma, however identifying the cells carrying dengue virus through the bloodstream in vivo has proven challenging. Here we used our recently developed viscRNA-Seq approach to profile transcriptomes of thousands of single blood peripheral mononuclear cells from 6 human subjects with dengue fever and severe dengue, as well as to characterize the cell types associated with dengue virus in the human blood. We found that although no bulk transcriptome marker for severe dengue exists, the expression of MX2 in naive B cells, of CD163 in CD14+/CD16+ monocytes and of other genes in specific cell types is highly predictive for severe dengue. We detected virus-associated cells in the blood of two severe dengue patients with high viral load and discovered the majority of these to be B cells expressing germline IgM or IgD immunoglobulin chains and naive markers but also showing signs of activation and expression of CD69, CXCR4, and other surface receptors. In bystander B cells we detected signs of strong immune activation, parallel hypersomatic evolution and, in one severe degue subject, an anomalously large clone of highly mutated, IgG1 plasmablasts that could be reactive to dengue virus. This study presents a high-resolution molecular exploration into dengue virus infection in humans and can be generalized to any RNA virus.

Viral priming of innate antiviral signaling by the unfolded protein response,PRJNA474353,"The cellular response to a pathogen is critical in determining the outcome of the infection and, as a consequence, viruses deploy a variety of strategies to subdue the antiviral signalling in order to achieve a productive infection. Stress and innate responses are believed to synergise to contain virus replication efficiently. However, the kinetics of the different cellular responses to viral infection and their contribution to innate antiviral signalling has not been clearly established. Tick-borne encephalitis virus, which is a Flavivirus widely diffused in Central Europe, has been shown to efficiently delay the interferon response. Transcriptome analysis of tick-borne encephalitis virus infected cells during the lag phase of interferon activation showed that, in addition to interferon and interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), the genes involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) were modulated. Intriguingly, this response was induced before interferon transcription. Infection in conditions of UPR priming led to early activation of IRF3, interferon and ISGs transcription, stress granules formation and inhibition of viral replication. This antiviral response in turn was dependent on the IRE1 arm of the UPR and on RIG-I, but was independent of the canonical interferon secondary signalling. Other members of the Flavivirus family such as West Nile virus, Dengue virus and Zika virus were also sensitive to UPR priming. These results demonstrate that the UPR is not only a physiological reaction of the cell to infection, but also favors the induction of the innate antiviral response. For the first time the synergy of the UPR with innate signalling is explained at the molecular level for a viral infection.Less...",
A host-dependent transcriptional response correlates with Dengue virus infection rate in healthy humans.,PRJNA436639;,"Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a major emerging disease in tropical and subtropical countries and the influence of host genetics during early phases of infection remains to be fully elucidated. Here we use dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages from healthy individuals to establish inter-individual variability in DENV infection and antibody-mediated enhancement (ADE). We show that host-related factors determine the severity of the infection rate both in DENV-infected DCs and macrophages following ADE. We then correlate the inter-individual variability in infection rates with genome-wide transcript abundance measured by RNA sequencing in DCs following DENV infection. We report 190 host-related transcripts in DCs that correlate markedly with infection rates that form an ubiquitin-mediated antiviral network. Furthermore, these transcripts are enriched for glycolysis, which we show is critical for the early phases of infection. Among virus induced transcripts (i.e. significant correlation only after DENV), we identify DUSP10 as the best indicator of the severity of infection. These results indicate the importance of host genetics in shaping the severity of DENV infection rates in DCs and identify novel potential DENV-susceptibility targets.
Overall design: Primary human DCs and macrophages were infected with dengue virus or dengue+antibody against dengue for 6 hours.

Single cell transcriptional dynamics of flavivirus infection,PRJNA433871;,"Dengue and Zika viral infections affect millions of people annually and can be complicated by hemorrhage or neurological manifestations, respectively. However, a thorough understanding of the host response to these viruses is lacking, partly because conventional approaches ignore heterogeneity in virus abundance across cells. We present viscRNA-Seq (virus-inclusive single cell RNA-Seq), an approach to probe the host transcriptome together with intracellular viral RNA at the single cell level. We applied viscRNA-Seq to monitor dengue and Zika virus infection in cultured cells and discovered extreme heterogeneity in virus abundance. We exploited this variation to identify host factors that show complex dynamics and a high degree of specificity for either virus, including proteins involved in the endoplasmic reticulum translocon, signal peptide processing, and membrane trafficking. We validated the viscRNA-Seq hits and discovered novel proviral and antiviral factors. viscRNA-Seq is a powerful approach to assess the genome-wide virus-host dynamics at single cell level.

IgG and IgA Immune Repertoires in Dengue Fever,PRJEB13768,"Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that affects nearly four millions of people every year.  Vector control is the main strategy to contain the threat because no effective treatments are available for Dengue viruses.  A new vaccine has recently been developed, but efficacies vary with both viral serotypes and exposure histories to vectors.  Dengue fever is unique in that the most severe presentations of the disease often occur after the initial febrile stage.  A second heterotypic infection is the most dangerous contributing factor for such complications as hemorrhage, plasma leakage, or even circulatory collapse.  Cross-reactive antibodies have been suggested to play aberrant roles in these situations, including the paradoxical enhancement of disease severity.  Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have allowed clonal characterization of antibody repertoires.  In this study we used NGS to analyze both IgG and IgA immune repertoires from Dengue patients.  Statistical heuristics efficiently revealed four infection signatures from IgG repertoires, two of which were identical to prior discoveries.  IgA repertoires were found more dissimilar to IgG repertoires among those patients with hemorrhages.  Diversity profiles of IgA repertoires between patients with or without hemorrhages were more distinct than those between IgG repertoires.  Variations of IgA repertoires as summarized by principal component analysis were sufficient to classify patients in accord with the phenotype.  Further analyses revealed seven IgA clusters closely associated with various forms of bleedings in Dengue fever.  In sum, our results not only demonstrated an efficient pipeline to discover infection signatures but also revealed hidden relationships between IgA repertoires and hemorrhages in Dengue fever.Less...",
Precursors of human CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes identified by single-cell transcriptome analysis [bulk RNA-seq],PRJNA417194;,"CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD4-CTLs) have been reported to play a protective role in several viral infections.

Homo sapiens isolate:H9 HESCs (WA09),PRJNA328608,"Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes profound changes in the host cells and these changes underlie the immune response-based viral clearance and pathogenesis. There are several major cell/tissue types relevant for DENV pathogenesis in vivo, including immune cells, liver, and vascular endothelial cells. We applied a directed differentiation system that produces hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) from pluripotent stem cells to investigate various aspects of DENV- hepatic cells interaction. Human embryonic stem cells were resistant to DENV infection while progeny hepatic cells were permissive. The transition to DENV permissiveness coincided with the upregulation of entry factors for the virus. Infection of HLCs by DENV was self-limiting due to the activation of the interferon (IFN) pathways, which protected by-stander cells from infection but failed to induce the same level of interferon-induced genes (ISGs) expression in the infected cells due to the subversion of IFN signaling by DENV. Innate immunity also protected the infected cells from virus-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, DENV infection activated the NF-κB pathway, increased production of reactive oxidative species (ROS), and led to production of inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the cytokine storm implicated in dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Finally, DENV infection of HLCs resulted several in vitro phenotypes that may have relevance for acute liver failure and vascular permeability during DHF. These include the disruption of adherens junctions and the downregulation of many liver specific genes such as albumin (ALB) and coagulation factor V (F5).Less...",
Homo sapiens,PRJNA328591;,"The goal of this study was to compare the transcriptional profile (RNA-seq) of Dengue virus 2 and mock infected cells at 24 and 36 hours post infection. Dengue virus NS5 protein plays multiple functions in the cytoplasm of infected cells, enabling viral RNA replication and counteracting host antiviral responses.  Here, we demonstrate a novel function of NS5 in the nucleus where it interferes with cellular splicing. Using global proteomic analysis of infected cells together with functional studies, we found that NS5 binds spliceosome complexes and modulates endogenous splicing. In particular, we show that NS5 alone, or in the context of viral infection, interacts with core components of the U5 snRNP particle, CD2BP2 and DDX23, alters the inclusion/exclusion ratio of alternative splicing events, and changes mRNA isoform abundance of known antiviral factors. Interestingly, a genome wide transcriptome analysis, using recently developed bioinformatics tools, revealed an increase of intron retention upon dengue virus infection, and viral replication was improved by silencing specific U5 components. Different mechanistic studies indicate that binding of NS5 to the spliceosome reduces the efficiency of pre-mRNA processing, independently of NS5 enzymatic activities. We propose that NS5 binding to U5 snRNP proteins hijacks the splicing machinery resulting in a less restrictive environment for viral replication.
